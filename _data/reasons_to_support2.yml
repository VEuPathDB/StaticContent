  image: question1.png
  answer: |
      Research generates tons of valuable data, but making sense of it is often difficult.  VEuPathDB helps scientists share, find, and use this data more easily.  It follows the FAIR principles — making data <b>Findable</b>, <b>Accessible</b>, <b>Interoperable</b>, and <b>Reusable</b> — which supports open science, innovation, and real-world health solutions.  New tools are being added to make it even easier for researchers to analyze and publish their own data
