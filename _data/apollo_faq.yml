  question: "What is Apollo?"
  answer: |
           Welcome to VEuPathDB Apollo ([Dunn et al 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726205/){:target='_blank'}), a real-time, collaborative genome annotation editor. Apollo is designed to support a worldwide community of scientists, to enable editing of gene model structural and functional properties. You can use Apollo for the [organisms available in VEuPathDB](https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/search/organism/GenomeDataTypes/result){:target='_blank'}. All reference genomes are currently available in Apollo; however, if the organism of interest to you is missing, you can request that it be made available for curation by emailing our team at ***help@VEuPathDB.org***.

  question: "How can I practice using Apollo"
  answer: |
           Use our Apollo test/play instance to practice using the tool. This tool allows you to experiment and get familiar with all Apollo menus, tools, and tracks before you decide to use it in the live instance for your real gene manual annotations. These changes will not affect any of the organism's official gene set, nor will be preserved. 
           
           [Click here](https://apollo-sandbox.veupathdb.org/annotator/index){:target='_blank'} to access the VEuPathDB Apollo Sandbox. Note that you will need to log in with your VEuPathDB credentials.

  question: "How can I use Apollo as a research or educational tool?"
  answer: |
           In addition to supporting the publication of vector, parasite, and fungi genome papers by genome consortiums ([Adema et al 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28508897/){:target='_blank'}, [Attardo et al 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31477173/){:target='_blank'}, [Olafson et al 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33750380/){:target='_blank'}), and facilitating the regular improvement of already published genomes ([Betting et al 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34210890/){:target='_blank'}, [Costa-Latg√© et al 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33897451/){:target='_blank'}), manual gene curation with Apollo can also be used as a research exercise with students (Hosmani et al 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30943207/){:target='_blank'}, Saha et al 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33884059/){:target='_blank'}). If you are interested in a VEuPathDB Apollo-specific training (workshop, webinar, or virtual lab meeting), either in person or virtual, contact us at ***help@VEuPathDB.org***.
           
           Apollo training can be structured to provide information on the principles associated with the identification of specific genes by comparison to gene structural aspects, how to search the genome for targets of interest, orthologs, and using the combination of gene predictions and additional evidence tracks to correct gene models with Apollo. Secondary analyses, such as BLAST comparison to other genomes and phylogenetic analyses can also be demonstrated. Discussions will include recommended standards for the minimum evidence required for annotating a gene model, gene naming conventions, and quality control checks, among other topics.

  question: "Can I use ClinEpiDB to analyze my own data?"
  answer: |
           At this time, ClinEpiDB does not allow you to upload and analyze your own data. However, you can [Contact Us](/a/app/contact-us){:target='_blank'} to inquire about having your own
           data loaded into the site.
