  question: VEuPathDB unlocks the power of research data
  answer: |
      Scientific data is the most valuable product of research, yet it is often difficult to share, find, access, interpret, and put to effective use. VEuPathDB provides a platform for researchers worldwide to contribute high-quality, genomic and functional datasets, thereby fulfilling data-sharing mandates from funders and publishers - while also making this information available for reuse in advancing new discoveries. VEuPathDB follows <b>FAIR</b> principles - making data <b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable, and <b>R</b>eusable - to transform research data into a user-friendly, reusable, curated, searchable resource, supporting open science and innovation. We are building new tools to expedite users' analysis and QC of their own data, deposition in archival repositories, and public release.

      As anyone who works with public databases knows, the level of *combined, integrated* high-quality data and added curation in the VEuPathDB is not replicated anywhere at the same level.

      Without access to the kinds of resources provided by VEuPathDB, the mycology, parasitology and vector biology fields will be entirely marginalized.  If I were a new investigator, I would not even consider working in a field where genomic-scale datasets - including not just sequence & annotation, but also functional & phenotypic data - were not readily and practically accessible to me on a daily basis (without having to turn myself into a technogeek)

  question: We make bioinformatics accessible to all researchers
  answer: |
      VEuPathDB removes technical barriers in bioinformatics by offering powerful tools that are easily accessible without the need for specialized computational or coding skills. The online platform uses intuitive, point-and-click interfaces, making complex data exploration easier for all researchers. Built-in analysis and visualization tools for established and emerging data types support various functionalities: genome browsing; functional enrichment analysis; comparative genomics; protein structure, function, and localization, etc. Providing deep insights while reducing financial and technological barriers levels the playing field by empowering scientists - including those in low-resource settings - to focus on discovery rather than data processing.
