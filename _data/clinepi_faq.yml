  question: "How do I cite ClinEpiDB?"
  answer: |
           If you want to cite ClinEpiDB directly, please use:

           > Ruhamyankaka E, Brunk BP, Dorsey G *et al.* ClinEpiDB: an open-access clinical epidemiology database resource encouraging online exploration of complex studies. [version 1; peer review: 2 approved]. *Gates Open Res* 2019, 3:1661 (<https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13087.2>{:target='_blank'})

           When citing a dataset that you accessed via ClinEpiDB, please include the dataset authors, 
           study name, date of release and release number on ClinEpiDB, study page URL, and the fact that 
           the data came from ClinEpiDB. For example, the citation for the PRISM Cohort study would be:

           > Dorsey G, Kamya M, Greenhouse B, *et al.* Study: PRISM Cohort. *ClinEpiDB*. 2018, 5 (<https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/record/dataset/DS_0ad509829e>{:target='_blank'})

           You can find the information on the study page by clicking the study name on the homepage 
           or on the dropdown 'Search a study' menu. The study name, release number, and release date 
           are at the top of the page, while authors are listed in the 'Principal Investigator and 
           Collaborators' table at the bottom of the page. You can also find links to original study 
           publications, which you may want to cite.

  question: "Can I use ClinEpiDB to analyze my own data?"
  answer: |
           ClinEpiDB does not allow you to upload and analyze your own data. However, you can 
           [Contact Us](/a/app/contact-us){:target='_blank'} to inquire about having your own 
           data loaded into the site.

  question: "How do I submit data?"
  answer: |
           To start, you should [Contact Us](/a/app/contact-us){:target='_blank'} to inquire about 
           having your data loaded into ClinEpiDB. Tell us about the study objectives and design, 
           the size of the dataset, types of variables, and your funding source. Then, check out our 
           [Data Submission Guidelines](/documents/ClinEpiDBDatasetGuidelinesforDataProviders.pdf){:target='_blank'} 
           to learn more about how to prepare your data for us and what additional files we need. 
           If we are able to integrate your data, we'll give you access to a secure Box folder where 
           you can upload your data and accompanying files.

  question: "How does ClinEpiDB protect human subject data?"
  answer: |
           1. We ask all users to agree to our [Data Access and Use Policy](/documents/DataAccessUsePolicyClinEpiDB.latest.pdf){:target='_blank'}
           2. Direct identifiers such as names and GPS coordinates are removed for all studies. Dates are obfuscated, locations are generalized, and additional indirect identifiers are removed or obfuscated as needed on a case-by-case basis. For some studies, subject IDs are re-assigned to break the link to the institution's copy of the data
           3. Data access restrictions are implemented as needed (see [Data Access and Use Policy](/documents/DataAccessUsePolicyClinEpiDB.latest.pdf){:target='_blank'})

  question: "If I want to share data via ClinEpiDB, do I need to include data sharing in my IRB proposal?"
  answer: |
           Yes! If you intend to make data available, it's important to include that in your consent
           forms and your IRB proposal. Our [IRB data sharing guidance](/documents/IRBDataSharingGuidance.pdf){:target='_blank'}
           document contains a brief summary of what to consider when putting together an IRB proposal.

  question: "Can I access the code used for ClinEpiDB?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Our code is maintained using [Git](https://github.com/VEuPathDB?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ClinEpi&type=&language=){:target='_blank'}, 
           and we welcome input from the community. For instance, check out our [Shiny app scripts](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/ClinEpiWebsite/tree/master/View/lib/R/shiny/apps){:target='_blank'}.

  question: "How does ClinEpiDB use ontologies?"
  answer: |
           We use the [VEuPathDB ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/eupath.html){:target='_blank'}, which is an Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontology, to increase data interoperability. As a part of ClinEpiDB data processing, every variable within a study is assigned to a unique ontology term. Each ontology term has its own identifier, called an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). For each term, we create a user-friendly label, which is what you see displayed as the variable name on ClinEpiDB and in the download files. These labels are generally consistent across studies. We don't display IRIs on the website, but you can find them in the download files. They look like "EUPATH_0000120" or "PATO_0000047".

           In our annotation we use the same ontology term in every study where the same variable was collected. For instance, information on participant sex was collected in all studies we have loaded so far, and you can find "Sex [PATO_0000047]"" in the download files for every study. To learn more, check out our general [Gates Open Research article](https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13087.2){:target='_blank'} or our [article on using ontologies](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/888e/a51dbb138122d39c42f863f2a1ada7976db4.pdf){:target='_blank'}.

  question: "What are the study accessibility levels?"
  answer: |
           There are currently 5 possible data access levels (public, controlled, protected, private, and prerelease). See the [Data Access and Use Policy](/a/app/static-content/ClinEpiDB/access_and_use.html){:target='_blank'} to learn more about the restrictions of each level.

  question: "Does ClinEpiDB assign persistent identifiers?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Each study is assigned their own stable identifier that begins with 'DS_'. This identifier is present in all URLs associated with that study, including the Study page. For more information on how to cite the data for a study loaded in ClinEpiDB, see [How do I cite ClinEpiDB?](#g2)

  question: "Is ClinEpiDB a data repository?"
  answer: |
           ClinEpiDB is a knowledge base that makes data more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). While data can be accessed, explored, and downloaded from our website, we also recommend depositing your data in a formal repository such as [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/){:target='_blank'} or [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/){:target='_blank'} to ensure long-term preservation.
