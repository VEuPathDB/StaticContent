  question: "Why was MicrobiomeDB created?"
  answer: |
           MicrobiomeDB was developed as a discovery tool that empowers researchers to analyze and visualize microbiome studies *without* requiring any programming skills.

           There are **six key strenghts of MicrobiomeDB** that set it apart from other microbiome resources:
           1. **A rich collection of curated microbiome studies** -  MicrobiomeDB hosts some of the largest microbiome studies ever conducted in human participants and is home to the largest curated collection of gut microbiome data from participants in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have traditionally been under-represented in microbiome databases.  For example, MicrobiomeDB hosts data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), the Malnutrition and Enteric Disease study (MAL-ED), THe Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study (PERCH), The DIABIMMUNE study, the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) phase 1 and 2, and more.  In addition, MicrobiomeDB hosts some of the largest and most detailed longitudinal studies of gut microbiome development in early life.
           2. **Integration of multi-omic microbiome studies** - Most microbiome database resources host only taxonomic data.  MicrobiomeDB is unique in that our platform is flexible enough to handle any 'omic datatype, which allows us to host multi-omic datasets on the site.  For example, metagenomic studies on our site include both taxonomic *and* functioanl data at the pathway and gene level, thus allowing users to quickly gain insight into functional potential of microbial communities.  However, our site is not limited to supporting sequence-based datatypes, and we currently host studies (e.g. [FARMM](https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/workspace/analyses/DS_4dfda49064/new)) that include both sequence and mass spec. metabolite data.  This integration enables researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of microbial communities and their functions.
           3. **A sophisticated interface for exploring and subsetting studies** - MicrobiomeDB's 'Browse and Subset' tool allows users to quickly subset any study, no matter the size or complexity, based on any available metadata variables.  This is particularly useful for large studies with many samples and complex clinical or epidemiological metadata, as it allows users to focus on specific groups of samples that are relevant to their research questions.  For example, users can easily filter a study to only include samples from a specific age group, geographic location, or disease state.
           4. **Ability to analyze your own data** - MicrobiomeDB allows users to upload their own microbiome data, which can be analyzed using the same tools and visualizations available for curated studies. This means that researchers can easily compare their own results with those from large, well-curated datasets.
           5. **A suite of point-and-click compute and visualization tools built from the ground up for microbiome data** - MicrobiomeDB allows users to carry out alpha- and beta-diversity analyses, ranked abundance testing, differential abundance analyses, correlation and network analyses, and much more!
           6. **Easily transition from web to coding tools** - The [MicrobiomeDB R package](https://microbiomedb.github.io/MicrobiomeDB/) provides a consistent set of functions to access all data and analytic tools on the site, allowing users to easily transition from web-based analyses to coding-based analyses. This is particularly useful for researchers who want to perform more advanced analyses or integrate MicrobiomeDB data with other datasets in their own code.
           Taken together, these features make MicrobiomeDB a powerful resource for microbiome research, enabling researchers to easily access and analyze large-scale microbiome datasets.

  question: "Who funded this site?"
  answer:
           We are grateful to have received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative's Essential Open Software for Science (EOSS - round 5)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/?cycle=5).

  question: "What's the difference between curated, private, and community studies?"
  answer: |
           * **Curated studies** - these datasets are manually curated by our staff and uploaded to the site for convenient public access.  Each curated study is represented on the homepage as as a study 'card'.  One major strength of Curated Studies is that the study metadata has been harmonized by our staff for convenient web display and study exploration.
           * **Private studies** - Any data uploaded by a user through the 'My studies' page is private by default.  Only you and people that you choose to share with can view this data.
           * **Community studies** - When/if the owner of a private dataset decides they are ready to share this data with all users of our site, they can convert a private dataset to a community dataset with the click of a button.  Importantly, unlike Curated Studies, Community Studies are not checked by our staff for data quality or metadata usage, thus it is up to the person sharing the Community Study to provide context and appropriate study and sample annotations so that other users can understand the value of their study. At any time, the original owner of community dataset can choose to revoke community access, which will revert the dataset back to private status. Community Studies can be queried and visualized in the same way as Curated Studies, but are not represented on the homepage as study cards.

  question: "What's up with all the cards on the homepage?"
  answer: |
           Each curated study hosted on our site is represented by a single study 'card' on the homepage.  The card provides a succinct summary of the study, including the name and goals of the study, the number and type of samples collected, and the types of assay data available (e.g. 16S, metagenomic, metabolomic).  To explore or analyze a study, simply click on the 'Explore the Data' button on the bottom of the card.

- type: datasets
  question: "How is the database populated?"
  answer: |
           MicrobiomeDB uses automated pipelines for loading raw fastq files from 16S rRNA marker gene profiling and 'shotgun' metagenomic studies.
           Raw 16S rRNA gene sequences are processed using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) and the [Silva database](https://www.arb-silva.de/) of high quality ribosomal RNA sequences.
           Raw shotgun metagenomic sequences are processed using [MetaPhlAn3](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan) and [HUMAnN3](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann).
           In addition to loading taxonomic data, MicrobiomeDB loads all 'metadata' terms used by the experimenter to describe each sample.
           These terms are mapped to the MIxS ontology and unmapped terms are manually curated and used to expand a custom, MIxS-compliant, ontology tree.
           These rich, structured sample details are used to generate an ISA.tab file that is then loaded into microbiomeDB.
           When combined with the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure developed by VEuPathDB,
           the user is provided with an web interface to interrogate complex, even massive-scale, microbiome studies using metadata queries.
           The resulting queries are then visualized using a suite of Shiny apps available directly in the browser.

  question: "Does the site handle data from shotgun metagenomic studies?"
  answer: |
           Yes!  As of release 21 (March 2021) we started loading shotgun metagenomic data.  In addition, if you have have your own metagenomic data that you're interested in analyzing on MicrobiomeDB, you can take advantage of our collaboration with [Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/) and [CZID](https://czid.org/)
           to generate a .biom file from your metagenomic study, then you can upload this directly to MicrobiomeDB under the Workspace menu (see next FAQ below).  You're not limited to taxonomic data either - our curated public metagenomic studies also have pathway-level and gene-level functional data, all of which can be mined using the same analyis and visualization tools on our site!
           Taken together, our goal is to develop a full-featured, open-source platform for a systems biology view of microbial communities.

  question: "How are datasets chosen for loading into MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           We consider several factors when prioritizing new studies to load into MicrobiomeDB.
           First, we have a strong interest in studies of the microbiome in infant and materal/child health and in enteric diseases.
           Second, we're also interested in understanding how different animal models (mice, dogs, pigs, etc) might help us understand the role of the microbiome during health and disease.
           Finally, we're interested in multifactorial and longitudinal datasets, since these qualities of datasets provide a unique opportunity to employ data mining and visualization to reveal interesting associations.
           If you have a dataset you would like us to consider loading into MicrobiomeDB, please get in touch with our team via the [Contact Us](https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/contact-us) link at the top of our home page.  We'd love to hear from you!

  question: "How do I carry out a search of curated public datasets?"
  answer: |
           Each study is represented on MicrobiomeDB using a small card.  All study cards can be found under the "Explore the Studies" section of the MicrobiomeDB homepage.
           Once you've identified a study to query, **click on the graph icon below 'Explore the Data'**,
           located on the bottom right of the card.  This will take you to our exploration and visualzation page.
           For more details on carrying out this type of query, take a look at the short video below.

  question: "Where can I find additional information for the large epidemiological studies you have loaded on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer:
           Several of the studies available on MicrobiomeDB, including the [GEMS1 Case Control study](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593), [MAL-ED 2yr](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_9d44f0a9b5), and [MAL-ED diarrhea](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_71c725321c)
           are all part of large studies where rich clinical and epidemiological data were collected from thousands of participants across multiple countries.
           For each of these studies, only a subset of participants had samples collected and processed for microbiome analysis.  Moreover, the sample metadata available on MicrobiomeDB for these studies includes only
           what was made available in the publication describing the results from the microbiome study.  Additional sample- and participant-level clinical and epidemiological data (often times extensive)
           are available for these participants and many more participants at our partner site, [ClinEpiDB.org](https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/).

  question: "Can I download data from MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           MicrobiomeDB provides a variety of options for downloading data from our site, depending on the type of study and the data you're interested in.
           * For all studies, you can download the taxonomy tables and study metadata in a tab-delimited text file format for either the entire dataset or your selected subset of samples.
           * For shotgun metagenomic studies, in addition to taxonomy tables and sample metadata, you can also download pathway-level and gene-level functional data in tab-delimited text file format.
           * What about raw sequence data?  We do not host raw sequence data for download.  For published studies the raw data is available on the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) or [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena).  If you're interested in accessing raw data for unpublished studies, we can faciliate contact with the data providers.
           * All data downloads are available from the 'Download' tab on the study page (see screenshot below).

  question: "Can I privately analyze my own unpublished data using the tools on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Simply register for a free account, and you'll have access to your own private user workspace, called 'My Studies', were you can upload **[.biom files](http://biom-format.org/)** from 16S or shotgun metagenomic studies, or import data from **[NIAID's Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/index)** resource.
           A .biom file can be produced from many standard 16S marker gene and shotgun metagenomic data processing pipelines.
           When creating your .biom file, be sure to incorporate metadata from your samples so that you can use these metadata variables to create informative data anlayses and visualizations on the site.
           If you are using QIIME to analyze your 16S data, be sure to take a look at [our QIIME2 protocol](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-16S-data-using-QIIME2-f225c95e34784cc3b726cff2d4d137cc).
           Instructions for generating a .biom file with metadata included are in the 'OPTIONAL: export .biom file' step in the protocol.

  question: "Can I analyze raw sequencing data (e.g. fastq files) using MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           You cannot upload raw sequence files directly to our site, *however* we have partnered with two fantastic organizations that have developed *free* resources which allow you to analyze your raw sequence data on their site but carry out downstream analysis and visualization on MicrobiomeDB. You have two options, but the first option is the most straightforward.
           1. **[Nephele resource from NIH-NIAID](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/)** - Through the Nephele website, you can upload your own raw sequence data from 16S, ITS or shotgun metagenomic studies.  You then select from a range of different standard computational workflows.  Once a workflow run is complete, you'll be notified by email and the results page will contain a 'magic link' that **allows you to directly import your results to MicrobiomeDB for analysis and visualization**.
           <img style="width:40em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/MicrobiomeDB/NepheleMagicLink.png" alt="Nephele Magic Link" align="left" />

           2. **[CZID resource from Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://czid.org/)** - CZID provides access to detailed assembly-based workflows for shotgun metagenomic data, and is particularly well-suited for pathogen discovery in complex samples.  Upload your raw data and choose which workflow you wish to run.  Once complete, select all your samples and click the download button.  You'll be presented with a few different options for the types of results you can download.  Choose the option for MicrobiomeDB, navigate to the 'My Studies' page on MicrobiomeDB (make sure you're logged in), and upload these files to our site.

  question: "How do you identify eukaryotes in metagenomic data on your site?"
  answer: |
           Detection of eukaryotes in shotgun studies on our site is based on the [EukDetect](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01015-y) marker gene database.
           Methods and software describing how we map reads to this reference database and call taxa can be found [here](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/corral-nextflow).
           You can read about our method for eukaryote detection - called CORRAL (clustering of related read alignments) - in **[our manuscript here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-023-01505-1)**.

  answer: |
           1. Choose the study of interest from the homepage, then click on the 'Explore the Data' button on the bottom of the study card.
           2. This will take you to the *'Browse and Subset'* page for that study.  If there's a specific eukaryote you're looking for, search for it using the text box.
           3. If you want to see all the microbial eukaryotes detected in your samples, open the *"Metagenomic sequencing assay"* parent node in the navigation tree.
           4. Open the *"CORRAL eukaryote detection and abundance analysis"* child node.
           5. *"Taxon dtected by sequence match"* gives you a yes/no result for which microbial eukaryotes were detected in each sample in your study.  *"Normalized number of taxon-specific sequence matches"* gives you the normalized counts of reads that were mapped to each microbial eukaryote in each sample.
           6. The *"Normalized number of taxon-specific sequence matches"* data can be used to generate visualizations of the microbial eukaryotes in your study using the 'Visualize' tab (e.g. calculating alpha diversity using only microbial eukaryotes).

           1. Choose the study of interest from the homepage, then click on the 'Explore the Data' button on the bottom of the study card.
           2. This will take you to the 'Browse and Subset' page for that study.  If you're looking for a specific pathway or gene, search for it using the text box.
           3. If you want to see all the pathway-level or gene-level data, open the *"Metagenomic sequencing assay"* parent node in the navigation tree.
           4. Open the *"Metagenome pathway and function analysis"* child node.
           5. Choose whether you want to see data at the pathway-level (*"Metagenome enzyme pathway abundance data"*) or gene-level (*"Metagenome gene abundance data"*).  You can also view pathway coverage (*"Metagenome enzyme pathway coverage data"*) since you may not care about an highly abundant pathway if only 10% of that pathway was covered by reads in a sample.
           6. The *"Normalized number of taxon-specific sequence matches"* data can be used to generate visualizations of the microbial eukaryotes in your study using the 'Visualize' tab (e.g. calculating alpha diversity using only microbial eukaryotes).

  question: "Why do some apps in the 'Visualize' tab appear ghosted or greyed out?"
  answer:
           Apps are only available when they are compatible with the data you have selected.  For example, if you have selected a study or a subset of samples that do not have a continuous metadata variable (e.g., age), you will not be able to use the bipartie app that correlates taxa with continuous metadata variables.

           In addition to citing our web resource (see above), you should also cite individual datasets that you accessed via MicrobiomeDB, please include the authors of the original publication that released the data (if published),
           study name, date of release and release number on MicrobiomeDB, study page URL, and the fact that
           the data came from MicrobiomeDB. For example, the citation for the Global Enteric Multicenter (GEMS) Case Control study would be:

           > Pop M, *et al.* Study: GEMS1 Case Control. *MicrobiomeDB*. 2018; release 9 (<https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593>{:target='_blank'})

           You can find the information on the study page by clicking the study name on the homepage
           or on the dropdown 'Search a study' menu. The study name, release number, and release date
           are at the top of the page, while authors are listed in the 'Principal Investigator and
           Collaborators' table at the bottom of the page. You can also find links to original study
           publications, which you may want to cite.
