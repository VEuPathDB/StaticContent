  question: "Why was MicrobiomeDB created?"
  answer: |
           High-throughput sequencing has revolutionized microbiology by allowing scientists to complement culture-based approaches with culture-independent profiling 
           of complex microbial communities. Whether studying these communities in soil, on plants, or in animals, the collection of community composition data is often 
           accompanied with rich metadata that describes the source from which the sample was derived, how samples were treated prior to collection, and how they were processed after collection. 
           Increasingly, the goal of microbiome experiments is to understand how these various attributes represented by the metadata, influence the microbial community. 
           **MicrobiomeDB was developed as a discovery tool that empowers researchers to fully leverage their experimental metadata to construct queries that interrogate microbiome datasets.**

  question: "How is the database populated?"
  answer: |
           MicrobiomeDB uses automated pipelines for loading raw fastq files from 16S rRNA marker gene profiling and 'shotgun' metagenomic studies. 
           Raw 16S rRNA gene sequences are processed using [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) and the [Silva database](https://www.arb-silva.de/) of high quality ribosomal RNA sequences.
           Raw shotgun metagenomic sequences are processed using [MetaPhlAn3](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan) and [HUMAnN3](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann).
           In addition to loading taxonomic data, MicrobiomeDB loads all 'metadata' terms used by the experimenter to describe each sample. 
           These terms are mapped to the MIxS ontology and unmapped terms are manually curated and used to expand a custom, MIxS-compliant, ontology tree. 
           These rich, structured sample details are used to generate an ISA.tab file that is then loaded into microbiomeDB. 
           When combined with the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure developed by VEuPathDB, 
           the user is provided with an web interface to interrogate complex, even massive-scale, microbiome studies using metadata queries. 
           The resulting queries are then visualized using a suite of Shiny apps available directly in the browser.

  question: "Does the site handle shotgun metagenomic data?"
  answer: |
           Yes!  As of release 21 (March 2021) we started loading shotgun metagenomic data.  In addition, if you have have your own metagenomic data that you're interested in analyzing on MicrobiomeDB, you can take advantage of our collaboration with [Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/) 
           to generate a .biom file from your metagenomic study, then you can upload this directly to MicrobiomeDB under the Workspace menu (see next FAQ below).  Currently we offer the ability to mine taxonomic data from shotgun studies but loooking ahead to future releases, 
           we anticipate being able to offer similar search, filter, and visualization tools for functional data such as pathway or gene abundnace. 
           Taken together, our goal is to develop a full-featured, open-source platform for a systems biology view of microbial communities.

  question: "What if I don't have a .biom file, but still want help analyzing raw sequence data?"
  answer: |
           We can help with that too!
           If you are interested in analyzing your own raw sequence data from 16S, ITS or shotgun metagenomic studies, check out **[NIAID's Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/index)** resource.
           You can run complete workflows on Nephele and produce a 'magic link' to your results.  This link is an authenticated URL that can be copied/pasted into the 'My Data Sets' page of MicrobiomeDB, 
           thus allowing direct transfer of results from Nephele to MicrobiomeDB for filtering, querying and visualizing your results.

  question: "Can I privately analyze my own unpublished data using the tools on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           Yes! Simply register for a free account, and you'll have access to your own private user workspace, called 'My Data Sets', were you can upload **[.biom files](http://biom-format.org/)** from 16S or shotgun metagenomic studies, or import data from **[NIAID's Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/index)** resource.
           A .biom file can be produced from standard 16S data processing pipelines, such as Mothur and QIIME.
           When creating your .biom file, be sure to incorporate metadata from your samples. 
           If you are using QIIME to analyze your 16S data, be sure to take a look at [our QIIME2 protocol](https://www.notion.so/Analysis-of-16S-data-using-QIIME2-f225c95e34784cc3b726cff2d4d137cc). 
           Instructions for generating a .biom file with metadata included are in the 'OPTIONAL: export .biom file' step in the protocol.

  question: "How are datasets chosen for loading into MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: |
           We consider several factors when prioritizing new studies to load into MicrobiomeDB.  
           First, we have a strong interest in studies of the microbiome in infant and materal/child health and in enteric diseases.  
           Second, we're also interested in understanding how different animal models (mice, dogs, pigs, etc) might help us understand the role of the microbiome during health and disease.  
           Finally, we're interested in multifactorial and longitudinal datasets, since these qualities of datasets provide a unique opportunity to employ data mining and visualization to reveal interesting associations.
           If you have a dataset you would like us to consider loading into MicrobiomeDB, please get in touch with our team via the [Contact Us](https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/contact-us) link at the top of our home page.  We'd love to hear from you!

  question: "Where can I find additional information for the large epidemiological studies you have loaded on MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer: 
           Several of the studies available on MicrobiomeDB, including the [GEMS1 Case Control study](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593), [MAL-ED 2yr](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_9d44f0a9b5), and [MAL-ED diarrhea](https://qa.microbiomedb.org/mbio.b17/app/record/dataset/DS_71c725321c)
           are all part of large studies where rich clinical and epidemiological data were collected from thousands of participants across multiple countries.
           For each of these studies, only a subset of participants had samples collected and processed for microbiome analysis.  Moreover, the sample metadata available on MicrobiomeDB for these studies includes only
           what was made available in the publication describing the results from the microbiome study.  Additional sample- and participant-level clinical and epidemiological data (often times extensive)
           are available for these participants and many more participants at our partner site, [ClinEpiDB.org](https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/).

  question: "Can I download raw data from MicrobiomeDB?"
  answer:  
           * For 16S studies, taxonomic data (counts and abundance) and sample metadata are available for download from MicrobiomeDB as separate text files or wrapped up into a single .biom file (see 'Download Data' link at the bottom of each study card).
           * For shotgun metagenomic studies, we offer the same file types mentioned above for 16S as well as both text and .biom options for pathway-level data and gene-level (Enzyme Commission number) data
           * Although we use raw sequence data (fastq files) when we load data into our website, we do not host these files for download. 
           * What about raw sequence data?  Well, for published studies the raw data is available on the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) or [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena).  If you're interested in accessing raw data for unpublished studies, we can faciliate contact with the data providers.

  question: "How do you identify eukaryotes in metagenomic data on your site?"
  answer: 
           Detection of eukaryotes in shotgun studies on our site is based on the [EukDetect](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01015-y) marker gene database.  
           Methods and software describing how we map reads to this reference database and call taxa can be found [here](https://github.com/wbazant/marker_alignments), and our nextflow workflow used to implement this approach on all samples on our database can be found [here](https://github.com/wbazant/marker-alignments-nextflow).
           We will soon be posting a preprint that describes this software and the rationale for implementing eukaryotic detection on MicrobiomeDB.
