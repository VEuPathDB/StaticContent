  question: VEuPathDB unlocks the power of research data
  image: question1.png
  answer: |
      Scientific data is the most valuable product of research, yet it is often difficult to share, find, access, interpret, and put to effective use. VEuPathDB provides a platform for researchers worldwide to contribute high-quality, genomic and functional datasets, thereby fulfilling data-sharing mandates from funders and publishers - while also making this information available for reuse in advancing new discoveries. VEuPathDB follows <b>FAIR</b> principles - making data <b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable, and <b>R</b>eusable - to transform research data into a user-friendly, reusable, curated, searchable resource, supporting open science and innovation. We are building new tools to expedite users' analysis and QC of their own data, deposition in archival repositories, and public release.

  question: We make bioinformatics accessible to all researchers
  image: question2.png
  answer: |
      VEuPathDB removes technical barriers in bioinformatics by offering powerful tools that are easily accessible without the need for specialized computational or coding skills. The online platform uses intuitive, point-and-click interfaces, making complex data exploration easier for all researchers. Built-in analysis and visualization tools for established and emerging data types support various functionalities: genome browsing; functional enrichment analysis; comparative genomics; protein structure, function, and localization, etc. Providing deep insights while reducing financial and technological barriers levels the playing field by empowering scientists - including those in low-resource settings - to focus on discovery rather than data processing.
