  question: VEuPathDB unlocks the power of research data
  image: question1.png
  answer: |
      Scientific data is the most valuable product of research, yet it is often difficult to share, find, access, interpret, and put to effective use. VEuPathDB provides a platform for researchers worldwide to contribute high-quality datasets, thereby fulfilling data-sharing mandates from funders and publishers. VEuPathDB follows <b>FAIR</b> principles - making data <b>F</b>indable, <b>A</b>ccessible, <b>I</b>nteroperable, and <b>R</b>eusable - to transform research data into a user-friendly, reusable, curated, searchable resource, supporting open science and innovation. We are building new tools to expedite users' analysis and QC of their own data, deposition in archival repositories, and public release.
