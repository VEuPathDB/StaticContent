  question: "Who uses VEuPathDB resources, and why?"
  answer: |
           In 2023, VEuPathDB resources were visited by an average of >45K unique users per month, from >150 countries, with the typical user returning several times each month.  >7 Tb of data is downloaded annually, and VEuPathDB resources have been cited >30K times in the scientific literature to date.  Numerous publications, reviews, and independent assessments attest that by providing convenient access to genomic-scale datasets and allowing users to interrogate these data and integrate the results obtained, VEuPathDB resources greatly facilitate discovery research and translational application, including the identification of therapeutic targets.
            
           Extensive outreach & training activities focus on ensuring that researchers can access and use available information effectively.  These efforts have been particularly effective in engaging the global community, including those in LMICs that often bear the brunt of infectious disease.  For example: African scientists account for ~5% of the global usage of the PlasmoDB and VectorBase databases supporting research on malaria and their Anopheles mosquito vectors, and 10% of global usage for PiroplasmaDB, supporting Theileria and Babesia pathogens of cattle.  VEuPathDB also provides a platform for the dissemination of new genomic-scale datasets, ensuring compliance with NIH data-sharing requirements and other emerging global standards for FAIR data-sharing, and permitting integration with other relevant information.
            
           In a 2024 survey asking VEuPathDB users to estimate the impact that the loss of this resource would have on lab productivity, >75% of >2000 respondents indicated an impact >50%.  Previous cost-efficacy estimates by the Wellcome Trust suggested an average impact of VEuPathDB on research productivity in individual labs of 20-30%.  There is no universally accepted metric for assessing impact, and database usage is highly variable from group to group … but it is clear that the value of VEuPathDB to the global research community is substantial.

  question: "What is the cost of VEuPathDB resources, who provides this support, and how is it allocated?"
  answer: |
           VEuPathDB resources have benefitted from >$150M investment since 1996 from the US NIH, UK Wellcome Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, US Dept Agriculture, and others.  From 2014-2024, the annual operating budget for VEuPathDB has averaged ~$8.5M in total costs; 6M in direct costs, of which ~60% has been provided by an NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Center contract, plus additional funding from the Wellcome Trust Resource Grants program and others.  This seems like a lot of money (and it is!), but production quality resources are considerably more expensive to operate than individual research projects, requiring professional staff for reliability & cybersecurity; data-loading, analysis & quality control; development of robust & performant software; database testing & quality control; community support, <i>etc</i>.
           
           Only ~10% of the VEuPathDB operating budget is required for maintenance of the live database as a static resource: ~$400K for hardware / compute / storage, plus minimal effort for systems/database administration, bug fixes, user support & institutional overhead … but without new data loading and the development of tools & queries to accommodate new datatypes, this information quickly goes stale.

           For new database releases, ~5% of the budget is required for compute costs associated with data processing.  >70% of the budget is allocated to personnel, including: project management and requirement definition & prioritization; computer & database administration associated with networking, cybersecurity, and the preparation & QC of new releases; cleaning, curation, processing, loading & QC of new data; developing the infrastructure necessary for loading, analyzing, presenting and mining new datatypes; and outreach activities to ensure effective utilization and dissemination of these resources.

           Since the cessation of the VEuPathDB BRC contract in Sept 2024, stop-gap funding has been provided by The Foundation for the Advancement of Science & Medicine, Open Philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the University of Pennsylvania; Penn and the University of Georgia have also agreed to waive institutional overhead for the duration of this transitional period.  This funding supports the maintenance of existing resources in static form and provides partial funding to implement infrastructure that will allow the resumption of regular database releases (with new genomes, functional datasets & analytical tools) in 2025 and plan for financial sustainability over the longer term.

           We are in the midst of re-engineering data processing & loading pipelines to improve efficiency & scalability, implementing AI tools to automate QC, data summarization, and other processes, renegotiating infrastructure subsidies, and reprioritizing development efforts.  These changes are projected to reduce total costs for 2025-26 to $5.3M/yr (a 38% reduction) without reducing support for new datasets or community engagement. 

           VEuPathDB is a non-profit operation; all funds are used for database development & support rather than research or other activities.

  question: "What other sources of grant and philanthropic support might replace the loss of BRC funding for VEuPathDB?"
  answer: |
           Various funding agencies – including (but not limited to) those that have previously supported VEuPathDB (see above) – are concerned about the impact of defunding this resource but cannot fill the gap, at least on short notice.  These groups are very interested in determining if a community-based financial model can be established to provide sustainable support for essential core resources and may be willing to help fund such an experiment.

           Concerned about the importance of VEuPathDB for global public health and the impact that its disappearance would have on tens of thousands of mycology, parasitology & vector biology researchers who depend on these databases for their work on a daily basis, several philanthropic groups have provided short-term funds allowing VEuPathDB to stay online while we develop a model for user-based support.  Many thanks to the Foundation for the Advancement of Science & Medicine, Open Philanthropy, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Univ Pennsylvania & Univ Georgia!

           The bottom line, however, is that long-term support for bioinformatics resources is increasingly challenging (<i>cf</i>: the loss of funding for the Arabidopsis, Aspergillus & Neurospora databases and projected reductions in support for model organism databases).  There is no realistic world in which VEuPathDB will remain available unless users are willing to help pay for resources they used to get for free … but with strong community buy-in, matching funds from granting agencies and philanthropic groups may be possible, to be supplemented by research grants for the development of innovative new informatics tools.

  question: "What strategies might help in reducing the cost of VEuPathDB resources?"
  answer: |  
           We are in the midst of re-engineering data processing & loading pipelines to improve efficiency & scalability, implementing AI tools to automate QC, data summarization, and other processes, renegotiating infrastructure subsidies, and reprioritizing development efforts.  These changes are projected to reduce total costs by 38% without any reduction in the release of new datasets or outreach support. 

           As a production resource with regularly scheduled releases to integrate new data, tools, and functionality, VEuPathDB employs a professional staff of software engineers, systems & database administrators, and subject matter experts.  Engaging students and volunteers is sometimes suggested as a cost-saving measure, and while such contributions have sometimes been useful for focused activities (such as initial annotation of new genomes), data curation is a highly specialized activity, and data processing/loading is highly sensitive to error, making oversight and QC a challenge.  Similarly, software developed by students and post-docs is typically designed for specific short-term applications rather than generalizability and robustness over the longer term.

           Reducing services could also cut costs, but surveys have shown that while most users employ certain tools and datasets regularly and others not at all, these individual preferences are non-overlapping: virtually all VEuPathDB functionality is heavily relied upon by a significant subset of users.  Moreover, once pipelines for data processing & loading have been developed and tools or services implemented, the marginal cost of application to new species or functional genomics datasets is usually minimal.  Eliminating support for specific taxa or datatypes would, therefore, have little impact on the overall VEuPathDB budget.  However, development or implementation of new tools can be expensive, and we anticipate that future development efforts will likely be pursued with support from research grants rather than user fees.

  question: "Would it help to host VEuPathDB database resources elsewhere?"
  answer: |  
           Unfortunately, no.  Computational resources (hardware, high-performance computing, storage, servers) constitute a small fraction (<10%) of the VEuPathDB budget.

  question: "Is it possible to fund VEuPathDB through charges based on actual usage, e.g. per site visit, or per database query?"
  answer: |  
           We are exploring various strategies for equitable assessment of user charges.  At present, charging per visit or per page hit (database query) appears unworkable, for a variety of logistical reasons: billing would be organizationally complex and expensive, and the design of our underlying relational databases means that individual inquiries can spawn widely-varying numbers of database queries.

  question: "Is it possible to fund VEuPathDB through ad revenue, or industrial support?"
  answer: |  
           We are keeping all options open, but based on actual site usage, these strategies are unlikely to yield a substantial revenue stream.  45K unique users per month represents a substantial number of research scientists, but relatively few when compared to websites supported by advertising (FaceBook, TikTok & YouTube have billions of unique users per month).  Industrial usage is modest, especially as many of the diseases caused by VEuPathDB-supported pathogens are most relevant to low-income countries.  Industry users indicate that they are willing to contribute their fair share based on usage … but this is unlikely to cover more than a fraction of annual costs.

  question: "What about tiered access (charging more for certain services)?"
  answer: |  
           One can envision a “freemium” model that charges extra for various services, such as help desk support, or access to the latest data, specific datatypes, or data analysis services.  This strategy has the disadvantage of disproportionately affecting those who require these resources the most, including researchers in low income countries most heavily affected by VEuPathDB-supported pathogen species.  Moreover, restricting access to certain services to paying customers would likely preclude grant or philanthropic support, and might compromise our certification as a core bioinformatics resource.

  question: "Are user fees or subscriptions a viable mechanism for support?  What would supporting VEuPathDB cost individual teams or institutions – my lab, for example?"
  answer: |  
           Financial models based on user surveys suggest that an allocation of 0.5-2% of relevant lab budgets would be sufficient to cover expenses, if the majority of current users are willing to contribute voluntarily, for their own benefit and that of the global community.  This would typically translate to an annual fee of ~$500-20K, depending on the size of the lab, and degree of engagement with VEuPathDB.  Larger operations would be expected to pay more because their usage of VEuPathDB resources – and their need to disseminate the genomic-scale datasets they produce – is greater, and typically scales in proportion to lab budgets.  Although substantial, these fees are well below estimated value (see above) or institutional rates proposed for data-sharing services.

  question: "How do I determine appropriate fees for my individual or academic group’s access to VEuPathDB resources?"
  answer: |  
           Please see our [subscription page](/a/app/static-content/subscriptions.html) to (privately) determine your fair share of VEuPathDB expenses based on the size of your operation and the degree of staff engagement with these resources.  Recognizing that labs differ greatly in size, scale of operations, and degree of database usage, and lab members also differ in the extent to which they use VEuPathDB, we recommend a fee based on ~2% of lab budgets for those who use these resources daily, 1% for weekly/monthly users, and 0.5% for irregular users.  <i>Note that this assessment is <10% of the value estimated by our users in surveys (see above)</i>.  Calculating invoices based on budget and database usage scales to accommodate considerable variability between laboratories: 1% of a $1M budget is $10K; 1% of a $10K budget is $100.

  question: "What if I have no funding to cover my subscription costs?"
  answer: |  
           While we will not impose a mandatory paywall or question payments deemed appropriate by individual labs, the costs required to support database resources are real.  Without some means of covering these expenses, VEuPathDB will disappear.  We are fortunate that philanthropic contributions allow us to subsidize subscriptions for those with severely limited financial resources, including unfunded laboratories and individuals, educators, and researchers in low-income countries.  To track usage, we require that all laboratory heads (not individual users) use the [subscription page](/a/app/static-content/subscriptions.html) to generate an invoice, even if the amount owed is $0.

  question: "Are there precedents for supporting genome database resources through user fees?"
  answer: |  
           There are many examples of online resources funded by voluntary user fees: Wikimedia receives >90% of its support from individual donations, and public broadcasting stations in the US typically receive a significant fraction of their support from individual donations.  There are fewer examples of bioinformatics database resources supported by user fees, but the *Arabidopsis* Information Resource ([TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/)) has been supported by a combination of grants and user subscriptions for a decade (although this resource differs from VEuPathDB in focusing more on manual curation, and provides fewer tools for data-mining and integrating diverse functional genomics data).  TAIR financing is managed by [Phoenix Bioinformatics](https://phoenixbioinfo.org/), which also supports other informatics resources, including CIPRES, CyVerse, MorphoBank & Repbase.  Other model organism databases, such as [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/) and [SGD](https://www.yeastgenome.org), have solicited optional website access fees with modest success.  Such efforts are likely to become increasingly common, as funders are increasingly reluctant to make long-term commitments for the maintenance of essential core resources.

  question: "How and when will it become clear if community investment is sufficient to support VEuPathDB?  What happens if more or less funds are available than required?"
  answer: |  
           VEuPathDB is not a profit-making operation, so if we successfully obtain more support than required – through a combination of user fees, grants/contracts, and philanthropic contributions – subscription rates will be reduced in future years.  We are currently budgeting for total costs of $5.3/yr in 2025-26 (a 38% reduction achieved through team restructuring and various efficiency measures; see above).  If we can only obtain 50% of this amount, it will likely mean an end to VEuPathDB, as it is unclear that this can support functionality more valuable than resources provided by NCBI and others at no cost to the end-user.  Note that it costs ~$1M/yr to simply maintain existing resources in static form – but without adding new data, such resources would rapidly become outdated.

           User surveys suggest that VEuPathDB provides value to the research communities that is >10x the cost of these resources, but this is ultimately up to the community to decide.  It may be useful to consider how the projected cost of a subscription for informatics resources compares to other lab expenses (e.g. meeting participation, service contracts, animal & tissue culture costs, bioinformatics services, publication charges, software licenses, student/postdoc stipends, etc).  It is also worth considering how the loss of convenient access to high-value datasets would impact the recruitment of new investigators into the field, affecting all aspects of research on these important species (not just genomics studies), and the neglected diseases they cause.

  question: "Why did VEuPathDB have to shut down in September, and when will it be possible to resume regular updates, incorporating new genomes, functional genomics datasets, etc?"
  answer: |  
           The termination of NIAID funding required infrastructure reorganization to support existing databases and queries despite the loss of staff and partners, and site reconfiguration to accurately acknowledge sources of support.

            - obtaining support for the 2nd year of the proposed two-year transition to financial sustainability
            - working with end users to define appropriate fees, scaled to lab budgets so as to accommodate diverse situations and provide invoices compatible w/ institutional & funder requirements
            - constructing new data mapping and loading infrastructure enabling resumption of regular database releases, while reviewing usage and cost-efficacy for all supported services
            - reinvigorating community advisory groups, working with end users to prioritize, source and release new genomes, functional genomics, and genome-scale phenotypic datasets (our NIH contract required shutting down community oversight of VEuPathDB(!); we look forward to re-establishing these advisory groups)
            - developing and/or implementing new/updated tools to keep up with the times, e.g. improved orthology algorithms, generic platform for representing scRNAseq atlases, etc
            - facilitating analysis & dissemination of user datasets, in keeping with emerging data-sharing requirements, along with AI-based methods to facilitate metadata collection and QC

We are also developing new tools enabling users to privately process, upload & QC their own data (sequence variants, RNA & protein expression, phenotypic results, etc), enabling public release whenever this is deemed appropriate (note that approval for any data release always rests with the data provider, rather than being imposed by VEuPathDB).

  question: "My gene ID has gone missing, how do I find it again?"
  answer: |
            Genomes are updated as assemblies improve, which can lead to old gene IDs being replaced by new ones. Alternatively, a gene may not be annotated on a new reference genome, and you want to find it.
            There are several ways to find old gene IDs:
            1.	Site search – if your old gene ID has a new alias, searching for it will bring up the current ID
            2.	Orthology and Synteny –  Ortholog transformation in search strategies and synteny tables on gene pages can be used to find alternate versions of the gene on different genomes. This is useful when trying to find an old annotation on a new reference genome.
            3.	Sequence searches – BLAST and BLAT tools are available on VEuPathDB sites and can help you locate similar sequences to your gene on other genomes.
            4.	Liftoff track – in some cases, a tool called liftoff has been used to help preserve old gene models between old and new reference genomes. It's results can be displayed as a track in JBrowse or Apollo and used alongside other evidence to annotate the new reference.

  question: "How to cite a gene? (We recommend gene stable ID, metadata and location)"
  answer: |
           Gene metadata are the gene name or symbol, e.g., GPROP1, and the gene functional description, e.g., long wavelength sensitive opsin. The gene stable IDs, e.g., AGAP013149, are not only stable (as implied by their name) but are provided as a unique identifier for each gene in each genome. The use of gene IDs allows for a better strategy when looking for genes using VEuPathDB Site Search or any other tool. A gene location can be in the format of supercontig/scaffold or chromosome and base pair range, e.g., 2R:735,912-737,457. We recommend you use gene stable ID, metadata and location, or at least gene ID and metadata in your thesis, paper, talk, poster or any other scientific publication.

  question: "How do I know if my new gene structure is correct in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. Check if your gene has a Start and Stop site. You can do this by zooming in. Alternatively, right-click on the gene to open the menu and select Get sequence. With this option you can recheck if there is a correct Start. You only need to check for correct start and stop sites if your gene does not have annotated UTRs. 
           2. Check splice sites. In most eukaryotes the majority of splice sites at the exon/intron boundaries appear as 5’-…exon]GT/AG[exon…-3’. An exclamation mark in Apollo shows non-canonical splice sites. 
           3. Check if you can annotate UTRs, for example using RNA-Seq data. A useful track that could help with this is the “Combined RNA-Seq plot”. This track combines all RNA-Seq plots available for your genome of interest. You can find this track by searching for “combine”.   
           4. Check sequence similarity by running blast. Right click on the gene in the User-created Annotations area, open the drop-down menu and select “Get sequence”. Copy the sequence to the clipboard and run [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

           1. IDA is used if the GO term/product has been experimentally verified.
           2. ISS: GO term/product is inferred from similarity. For GO annotations add GO_REF:0000024 as reference. GO references describe the methods and procedures used in creating such annotations.
           3. ISM: GO term/product is inferred from InterPro/Pfam domain. Add GO_REF:000011 in the reference field for GO annotations.
           4. IMP: GO term/product is inferred from mutant phenotype.
           Additional information on evidence codes can be found here: [Guide to GO evidence codes](http://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes)

  question: "How can I programmatically download genome files?"
  answer: |
          Presented below are two options to programmatic (command line) access and download genome files from our servers. Examples below are for the FungiDB genome, <a href="https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/">Spombe972h.</a>.  Genome files from every organism and release are available in the Downloads section.  To find the URL for your preferred organism and see our directory structure, go to the header and choose >Data > Download data file. <br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/programaticallydownloadgenomefile.png"  />
          or to get a list of GFF, genome fasta, and protein fasta file names (from a component site, e.g. FungiDB.org) go to the header and choose searches > Organisms  > Organisms: Genome Info & Stats <br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/genome_info_stats.png"  />
          Then click Download, then choose a report output to download, and add the columns for the file location of the file  types you want (options are, as shown “GFF Download Link, Genome Fasta Download Link, and Protein Fasta Download link)<br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/info_stats_2.png"  />
           1. WGET: You can use wget and the url for the data file as the path.  For example, to download the genome.fasta file for Spombe972h from FungiDB Release 61 try:<br>
           wget https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-61/Spombe972h/fasta/data/FungiDB-61_Spombe972h_Genome.fasta   
           
           2. LFTP: This file transfer program also works.  After finding the correct directory try the command such as:<br>
           lftp https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/<br>
           and then use a command such as: <br>
           mget fasta/data/*<br>
           OR<br>
           mget gff/data/*<br>
           to get all files in that folder.

  question: "How can I convert GFF downloads to GTF format?"
  answer: |
          <b>Why doesn't VEuPathDB offer GTF downloads?</b>
          <p>GTF and GFF formats contain broadly the same type of data; a table of features in a genome referencing the chromosome or contig the feature is found on, the coordinates of the feature and some metadata about the feature. GTF is a tightly structured format which only supports genes and sub-features of genes (UTRs, exons, CDS etc.). GFF is more flexible. We have chosen to use GFF because it allows us to include other types of features where it is relevant to do so, for example centromeres or repeat regions. It also allows us to provide more information about certain kinds of features, for example to differentiate protein-coding genes from non-coding genes.</p>
          <br>

          <b>What are the differences between GFF and GTF files?</b>
          <p>Both formats are tab delimited files with 9 columns. The columns are as follows:
              <ol>
                  <li>Sequence identifier: the chromosome or contig containing this feature</li>
                  <li>Source: the source of this annotation</li>
                  <li>Feature: the type of feature (gene, transcript, exon, CDS etc.)</li>
                  <li>Start: the start coordinate for this feature</li>
                  <li>End: the end coordinate for this feature</li>
                  <li>Score: If relevant a score for this feature. (empty if no score)</li>
                  <li>Strand: If relevant, the strand for this feature (+, - or empty)</li>
                  <li>Frame: If relevant, the frame for this feature (0, 1, 2 or empty)</li>
                  <li>Attributes: Metadata about this feature</li>
              </ol>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The differences between GFF and GTF formats are in column 3, and column 9.</p>
          <br>

          <p>Column three defines the type of feature. GTF files only allow a restricted set of types:
              <ul>
                  <li>gene</li>
                  <li>transcript</li>
                  <li>exon</li>
                  <li>CDS</li>
                  <li>Selenocysteine</li>
                  <li>start_codon</li>
                  <li>stop_codon</li>
                  <li>three_prime_utr</li>
                  <li>five_prime_utr</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>GFF files are much less restrictive, allowing inclusion of any term from the <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/" target="_blank" title="Sequence Ontology">Sequence Ontology</a>.</p>
          <br>

          <p>Column nine allows inclusion of metadata about the feature. GTF files require metadata in the format <i>attribute1 "attribute_value1"; attribute2 "attribute_value2"</i>. The attributes must contain an ID containing a unique identifier for the feature, and gene_id, and transcript_id attributes defining the parents of each feature. GFF files require metadata in the format <i>attribute1=attribute_value1;attribute2=attribute_value2</i>. The attributes must contain an ID attribute containing a unique identifier for the feature, and features that have parents must reference the ID of their direct parent using a Parent attribute.</p>

          <p>For more information about GFF and GTF formats, see <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gxf.html" target="_blank" title="GFF and GTF formats">this</a> page.</p>
          <br>

          <b>Do I need to convert GFF to GTF?</b> 
          <p>Not always!</p>

          <p>In addition to the mandatory Parent attribute in GFF files, we have added a gene_id attribute compatible with the GTF specification. This means that you can use our GFF files directly with some tools without conversion. <a href="https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/index.html" target="_blank" title="HTSeq-count">HTSeq-count</a> is an example of one tool where this is possible.</p>

          <p>There are some circumstances where you will need to convert. These include:
              <ul>
                  <li>When a tool comes across sequence ontology terms in column 3 of the GFF file that are not allowed in GTF files. Some tools will ignore these terms, but for other tools these will cause errors</li>
                  <li>When a tool does not understand the format of the attribute column (column 9) in a GFF file</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <br>

          <b>How do I convert to GTF format?</b>
          <p>Converting GFF to GTF is not always straight forward because both formats have flexible specifications. A common problem is robustly mapping the diverse Sequence Ontology terms allowed in GFF files to the resticted set allowed in GTF files. Many tools are available to do this conversion, but not all will work as expected. We recommend <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" title="AGAT">AGAT</a> as we have worked with the developers to ensure their tool is fully compatible with the Sequence Ontology terms used in our GFF files.</p>
          <br>

          <b>Running AGAT at the command line</b>
          <p>In order to use AGAT, <b>please ensure you have version 0.9.0 or later installed</b> for full compatibility with our GFF files. Installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT#installation" target="_blank" title="AGAT installation">here</a>. We recommend Conda as the easiest method for most people. AGAT has many scripts for interacting with GFF files. For GFF to GTF conversion, the script required is called <i>agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl</i>. An example command line is:<br><br><i>agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff myGffFile.gff -o myGtfFile.gtf</i>.<br><br><i>myGffFile.gff</i> and <i>myGtfFile.gtf</i> should be substituted for the name of the GFF file you wish to convert, and the desired name of your GTF file. A full manual can be found <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" title="AGAT manual">here</a>.</p>

  question: "Why are genome annotation files at VEuPathDB different from NCBI, ENA, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, or other repositories?"
  answer: |
          If you use the annotation files from other repositories and come back to VEuPathDB for downstream analyses, you might find that some of your genes of interest are missing or have a different gene ID, due to structural or functional annotation changes. To download the file, go to the header of the site under the “Data” menu and click on “Download data files”, e.g., https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/downloads.learn and to learn why there is a difference between the INSDC archival databases and VEuPathDB <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/apollo_help.html" target="_blank" title="Apollo landing page">follow this link to Apollo</a> to learn about our genome update workflow.

  question: "How can I check if the gene structure of my gene of interest is correct?"
  answer: |
          VEuPathDB integrates different data types and tools that can help you evaluate your gene model of interest:
           1. <b>RNA-Seq Evidence for Introns genome browser track:</b> This analysis is generated from all RNAseq data loaded and is available on the gene record page in the Gene Models section in the JBrowse window. This track provides evidence for introns and allows you to confirm gene model introns or discover possible missing exons, incorrect exon/intron boundaries or alternative transcripts. It also provides information if a gene model should be split, merged or if there is a possible missing gene model. The track is divided into two sections. On the top there are intron junctions that match the annotation. Below this, the track shows unannotated introns with strong evidence that indicate a possible incorrect/alternative gene structure. <i>Hint: Go to the drop-down menu of the track and select "Show labels" to see how many reads confirm the intron junctions.</i>
           2. <b>Combined RNAseq plot genome browser track:</b> This track combines coverage data for all available RNAseq data. It is shown in the Gene Models section in the JBrowse window. This track will give you an indication about the length of the 3’ and 5’ UTRs, possible incorrect introns and missing exons. The track also provides information if your gene has an incorrect start and is too long (attached example). <i>Please note: This track is not always visible. To view this track use the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the JBrowse window.</i>
           3. <b>Gene models can be explored further in the genome browser:</b> The browser can be accessed from the gene record page or the tools menu. The availability of data tracks will vary based on your genome of interest. More information on how to explore gene models in JBrowse can be found in this <a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/2023Virtual/Exploring-gene-models.pdf">workshop exercise.</a>
           4. <b>Explore Sequence and scaffold structure:</b> Gaps in sequencing may result in incomplete gene models. For example, if you explore the sequence section of the gene record page and notice that your gene of interest is missing  a Methionine you can find out if this is due to a sequencing gap. Open the genome browser and select the track Scaffolds and Gaps. This will give you an indication if your gene is incorrectly annotated or is partial due to being located next to a gap/contig boundary. To learn more on how to select tracks in JBrowse have a look at this <a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/JBrowseBasics.pdf">tutorial</a>.
           5. <b>Explore the Orthology and Synteny section:</b> Missing orthologs can be an indication of a possible problem with your gene of interest. The synteny view can also provide additional information on your gene of interest. This data can be explored from the orthology and synteny section of the gene page or in the genome browser.
