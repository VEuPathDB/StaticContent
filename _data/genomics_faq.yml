  question: "How to cite a gene? (We recommend gene stable ID, metadata and location)"
  answer: |
           Gene metadata are the gene name or symbol, e.g., GPROP1, and the gene functional description, e.g., long wavelength sensitive opsin. The gene stable IDs, e.g., AGAP013149, are not only stable (as implied by their name) but are provided as a unique identifier for each gene in each genome. The use of gene IDs allows for a better strategy when looking for genes using VEuPathDB Site Search or any other tool. A gene location can be in the format of supercontig/scaffold or chromosome and base pair range, e.g., 2R:735,912-737,457. We recommend you use gene stable ID, metadata and location, or at least gene ID and metadata in your thesis, paper, talk, poster or any other scientific publication.

  question: "Exporting from Galaxy/Globus to VEuPathDB returns a user email not valid error. How can I fix this?"
  answer: |
           This is most likely caused by you having a Galaxy account created outside VEuPathDB.
           To check this, click on “User” from the home page. If the email address listed does not end in “@veupathdb.org”, then you are using a non-VEuPathDB account. This account could have been created through the Globus system.
           If you do not have a “@veupathdb.org” address listed here, our systems will not be able to link your Galaxy account to your VEuPathDB account.

            <img src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_16.png"  />
           

           <p>To fix this, go here: https://app.globus.org/account/identities
           You will likely have a primary identity consisting of your non-VEuPathDB email address:</p>

            <img style="width:45em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_17.png"  />

           <p>If so, you need to unlink your VEuPathDB account from your other account by selecting ‘Manage Identities’ and pressing the Trash icon next to your VEuPathDB user name. This will not delete the VEuPathDB account, but will remove it from this particular Globus identity. Log out from this Globus identity.</p>
           <p>Then, you must log out of Galaxy. Then log back into Galaxy using your VEuPathDB credentials -- this will likely create a new Galaxy account. Also, this will create a new Globus identity in which your VEuPathDB is the only account and also the primary identity. To verify that this worked, press the User menu in Galaxy and you should see your VEuPathDB user name: for example, mark123456789@veupathdb.org.</p>
           <p>To transfer your work from your old non-VEuPathDB account to your new VEuPathDB account, share your history from the non-VEuPathDB account to the VEuPathDB account. Import the history into your VEuPathDB account.</p>
           <p>Now you can export to our VEuPathDB websites. You should use this particular Galaxy account to do your future VEuPathDB work, so that you can export to VEuPathDB and so that we can contact you with important information about VEuPathDB Galaxy.</p>

  question: "How do I know if my new gene structure is correct in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. Check if your gene has a Start and Stop site. You can do this by zooming in. Alternatively, right-click on the gene to open the menu and select Get sequence. With this option you can recheck if there is a correct Start. You only need to check for correct start and stop sites if your gene does not have annotated UTRs. 
           2. Check splice sites. In most eukaryotes the majority of splice sites at the exon/intron boundaries appear as 5’-…exon]GT/AG[exon…-3’. An exclamation mark in Apollo shows non-canonical splice sites. 
           3. Check if you can annotate UTRs, for example using RNA-Seq data. A useful track that could help with this is the “Combined RNA-Seq plot”. This track combines all RNA-Seq plots available for your genome of interest. You can find this track by searching for “combine”.   
           4. Check sequence similarity by running blast. Right click on the gene in the User-created Annotations area, open the drop-down menu and select “Get sequence”. Copy the sequence to the clipboard and run [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

  question: "Which evidence code should be used when adding GO terms or gene products in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. IDA is used if the GO term/product has been experimentally verified.
           2. ISS: GO term/product is inferred from similarity. For GO annotations add GO_REF:0000024 as reference. GO references describe the methods and procedures used in creating such annotations.
           3. ISM: GO term/product is inferred from InterPro/Pfam domain. Add GO_REF:000011 in the reference field for GO annotations.
           4. IMP: GO term/product is inferred from mutant phenotype.
           Additional information on evidence codes can be found here: [Guide to GO evidence codes](http://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes)

  question: "How can I programmatically download genome files?"
  answer: |
          Presented below are two options to programmatic (command line) access and download genome files from our servers. Examples below are for the FungiDB genome, <a href="https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/">Spombe972h.</a>.  Genome files from every organism and release are available in the Downloads section.  To find the URL for your preferred organism and see our directory structure, go to the header and choose >Data > Download data file. <br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/programaticallydownloadgenomefile.png"  />
          or to get a list of GFF, genome fasta, and protein fasta file names (from a component site, e.g. FungiDB.org) go to the header and choose searches > Organisms  > Organisms: Genome Info & Stats <br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/genome_info_stats.png"  />
          Then click Download, then choose a report output to download, and add the columns for the file location of the file  types you want (options are, as shown “GFF Download Link, Genome Fasta Download Link, and Protein Fasta Download link)<br>
          <img style="width:30em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/info_stats_2.png"  />
           1. WGET: You can use wget and the url for the data file as the path.  For example, to download the genome.fasta file for Spombe972h from FungiDB Release 61 try:<br>
           wget https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/release-61/Spombe972h/fasta/data/FungiDB-61_Spombe972h_Genome.fasta   
           
           2. LFTP: This file transfer program also works.  After finding the correct directory try the command such as:<br>
           lftp https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/<br>
           and then use a command such as: <br>
           mget fasta/data/*<br>
           OR<br>
           mget gff/data/*<br>
           to get all files in that folder.

  question: "How can I convert GFF downloads to GTF format?"
  answer: |
          <b>Why doesn't VEuPathDB offer GTF downloads?</b>
          <p>GTF and GFF formats contain broadly the same type of data; a table of features in a genome referencing the chromosome or contig the feature is found on, the coordinates of the feature and some metadata about the feature. GTF is a tightly structured format which only supports genes and sub-features of genes (UTRs, exons, CDS etc.). GFF is more flexible. We have chosen to use GFF because it allows us to include other types of features where it is relevant to do so, for example centromeres or repeat regions. It also allows us to provide more information about certain kinds of features, for example to differentiate protein-coding genes from non-coding genes.</p>
          <br>

          <b>What are the differences between GFF and GTF files?</b>
          <p>Both formats are tab delimited files with 9 columns. The columns are as follows:
              <ol>
                  <li>Sequence identifier: the chromosome or contig containing this feature</li>
                  <li>Source: the source of this annotation</li>
                  <li>Feature: the type of feature (gene, transcript, exon, CDS etc.)</li>
                  <li>Start: the start coordinate for this feature</li>
                  <li>End: the end coordinate for this feature</li>
                  <li>Score: If relevant a score for this feature. (empty if no score)</li>
                  <li>Strand: If relevant, the strand for this feature (+, - or empty)</li>
                  <li>Frame: If relevant, the frame for this feature (0, 1, 2 or empty)</li>
                  <li>Attributes: Metadata about this feature</li>
              </ol>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The differences between GFF and GTF formats are in column 3, and column 9.</p>
          <br>

          <p>Column three defines the type of feature. GTF files only allow a restricted set of types:
              <ul>
                  <li>gene</li>
                  <li>transcript</li>
                  <li>exon</li>
                  <li>CDS</li>
                  <li>Selenocysteine</li>
                  <li>start_codon</li>
                  <li>stop_codon</li>
                  <li>three_prime_utr</li>
                  <li>five_prime_utr</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>GFF files are much less restrictive, allowing inclusion of any term from the <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/" target="_blank" title="Sequence Ontology">Sequence Ontology</a>.</p>
          <br>

          <p>Column nine allows inclusion of metadata about the feature. GTF files require metadata in the format <i>attribute1 "attribute_value1"; attribute2 "attribute_value2"</i>. The attributes must contain an ID containing a unique identifier for the feature, and gene_id, and transcript_id attributes defining the parents of each feature. GFF files require metadata in the format <i>attribute1=attribute_value1;attribute2=attribute_value2</i>. The attributes must contain an ID attribute containing a unique identifier for the feature, and features that have parents must reference the ID of their direct parent using a Parent attribute.</p>

          <p>For more information about GFF and GTF formats, see <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gxf.html" target="_blank" title="GFF and GTF formats">this</a> page.</p>
          <br>

          <b>Do I need to convert GFF to GTF?</b> 
          <p>Not always!</p>

          <p>In addition to the mandatory Parent attribute in GFF files, we have added a gene_id attribute compatible with the GTF specification. This means that you can use our GFF files directly with some tools without conversion. <a href="https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/index.html" target="_blank" title="HTSeq-count">HTSeq-count</a> is an example of one tool where this is possible.</p>

          <p>There are some circumstances where you will need to convert. These include:
              <ul>
                  <li>When a tool comes across sequence ontology terms in column 3 of the GFF file that are not allowed in GTF files. Some tools will ignore these terms, but for other tools these will cause errors</li>
                  <li>When a tool does not understand the format of the attribute column (column 9) in a GFF file</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <br>

          <b>How do I convert to GTF format?</b>
          <p>Converting GFF to GTF is not always straight forward because both formats have flexible specifications. A common problem is robustly mapping the diverse Sequence Ontology terms allowed in GFF files to the resticted set allowed in GTF files. Many tools are available to do this conversion, but not all will work as expected. We recommend <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" title="AGAT">AGAT</a> as we have worked with the developers to ensure their tool is fully compatible with the Sequence Ontology terms used in our GFF files.</p>
          <br>

          <b>Running AGAT at the command line</b>
          <p>In order to use AGAT, <b>please ensure you have version 0.9.0 or later installed</b> for full compatibility with our GFF files. Installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT#installation" target="_blank" title="AGAT installation">here</a>. We recommend Conda as the easiest method for most people. AGAT has many scripts for interacting with GFF files. For GFF to GTF conversion, the script required is called <i>agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl</i>. An example command line is:<br><br><i>agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff myGffFile.gff -o myGtfFile.gtf</i>.<br><br><i>myGffFile.gff</i> and <i>myGtfFile.gtf</i> should be substituted for the name of the GFF file you wish to convert, and the desired name of your GTF file. A full manual can be found <a href="https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" title="AGAT manual">here</a>.</p>

  question: "Why are genome annotation files at VEuPathDB different from NCBI, ENA, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, or other repositories?"
  answer: |
          If you use the annotation files from other repositories and come back to VEuPathDB for downstream analyses, you might find that some of your genes of interest are missing or have a different gene ID, due to structural or functional annotation changes. To download the file, go to the header of the site under the “Data” menu and click on “Download data files”, e.g., https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/downloads.learn and to learn why there is a difference between the INSDC archival databases and VEuPathDB <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/apollo_help.html" target="_blank" title="Apollo landing page">follow this link to Apollo</a> to learn about our genome update workflow.

  question: "How can I check if the gene structure of my gene of interest is correct?"
  answer: |
          VEuPathDB integrates different data types and tools that can help you evaluate your gene model of interest:
           1. <b>RNA-Seq Evidence for Introns genome browser track:</b> This analysis is generated from all RNAseq data loaded and is available on the gene record page in the Gene Models section in the JBrowse window. This track provides evidence for introns and allows you to confirm gene model introns or discover possible missing exons, incorrect exon/intron boundaries or alternative transcripts. It also provides information if a gene model should be split, merged or if there is a possible missing gene model. The track is divided into two sections. On the top there are intron junctions that match the annotation. Below this, the track shows unannotated introns with strong evidence that indicate a possible incorrect/alternative gene structure. <i>Hint: Go to the drop-down menu of the track and select "Show labels" to see how many reads confirm the intron junctions.</i>
           2. <b>Combined RNAseq plot genome browser track:</b> This track combines coverage data for all available RNAseq data. It is shown in the Gene Models section in the JBrowse window. This track will give you an indication about the length of the 3’ and 5’ UTRs, possible incorrect introns and missing exons. The track also provides information if your gene has an incorrect start and is too long (attached example). <i>Please note: This track is not always visible. To view this track use the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the JBrowse window.</i>
           3. <b>Gene models can be explored further in the genome browser:</b> The browser can be accessed from the gene record page or the tools menu. The availability of data tracks will vary based on your genome of interest. More information on how to explore gene models in JBrowse can be found in this <a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/2023Virtual/Exploring-gene-models.pdf">workshop exercise.</a>
           4. <b>Explore Sequence and scaffold structure:</b> Gaps in sequencing may result in incomplete gene models. For example, if you explore the sequence section of the gene record page and notice that your gene of interest is missing  a Methionine you can find out if this is due to a sequencing gap. Open the genome browser and select the track Scaffolds and Gaps. This will give you an indication if your gene is incorrectly annotated or is partial due to being located next to a gap/contig boundary. To learn more on how to select tracks in JBrowse have a look at this <a href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/JBrowseBasics.pdf">tutorial</a>.
           5. <b>Explore the Orthology and Synteny section of your gene of interest to see if there are any orthologs:</b> Missing orthologs can be an indication of a possible problem with your gene of interest. The synteny view can also provide additional information on your gene of interest. This data can be explored from the orthology and synteny section of the gene page or in the genome browser.
