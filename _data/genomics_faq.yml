  question: "Exporting from Galaxy/Globus to VEuPathDB returns a user email not valid error. How can I fix this?"
  answer: |
           This is most likely caused by you having a Galaxy account created outside VEuPathDB.
           To check this, click on “User” from the home page. If the email address listed does not end in “@veupathdb.org”, then you are using a non-VEuPathDB account. This account could have been created through the Globus system.
           If you do not have a “@veupathdb.org” address listed here, our systems will not be able to link your Galaxy account to your VEuPathDB account.

            <img src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_16.png"  />
           

           <p>To fix this, go here: https://app.globus.org/account/identities
           You will likely have a primary identity consisting of your non-VEuPathDB email address:</p>

            <img style="width:45em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_17.png"  />

           <p>If so, you need to unlink your VEuPathDB account from your other account by selecting ‘Manage Identities’ and pressing the Trash icon next to your VEuPathDB user name. This will not delete the VEuPathDB account, but will remove it from this particular Globus identity. Log out from this Globus identity.</p>
           <p>Then, you must log out of Galaxy. Then log back into Galaxy using your VEuPathDB credentials -- this will likely create a new Galaxy account. Also, this will create a new Globus identity in which your VEuPathDB is the only account and also the primary identity. To verify that this worked, press the User menu in Galaxy and you should see your VEuPathDB user name: for example, mark123456789@veupathdb.org.</p>
           <p>To transfer your work from your old non-VEuPathDB account to your new VEuPathDB account, share your history from the non-VEuPathDB account to the VEuPathDB account. Import the history into your VEuPathDB account.</p>
           <p>Now you can export to our VEuPathDB websites. You should use this particular Galaxy account to do your future VEuPathDB work, so that you can export to VEuPathDB and so that we can contact you with important information about VEuPathDB Galaxy.</p>

  question: "What can I do if a gene model is incorrect or missing?"
  answer: |
           1. Go to the gene record page of your gene of interest. In case of a missing gene, choose the gene  record page of a neighbouring gene. 
           2. There are two options. Option 1 is to add a user comment. Select “Add the first user comment”.  To add a user comment you need to be logged in.  
           3. In the user comment window provide details about the incorrect/missing gene. The comment  will be displayed on the gene record page after you’ve submitted it.  
           4. The second option is to correct the gene model in Apollo. To do so, click on the “View and  update community annotations in Apollo” link on the gene record page.  
           5. You need to be logged in to VEuPathDB to use Apollo. If you want to correct a gene model in  Apollo follow the steps in the tutorials on the [Apollo page](/a/app/static-content/apollo_help.html). Some organisms are currently unavailable in Apollo. You can request these organisms to be available for curation, [click here to contact us](/a/app/contact-us).

  question: "How do I know if my new gene structure is correct in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. Check if your gene has a Start and Stop site. You can do this by zooming in. Alternatively, right-click on the gene to open the menu and select Get sequence. With this option you can recheck if there is a correct Start. You only need to check for correct start and stop sites if your gene does not have annotated UTRs. 
           2. Check splice sites. In most eukaryotes the majority of splice sites at the exon/intron boundaries appear as 5’-…exon]GT/AG[exon…-3’. An exclamation mark in Apollo shows non-canonical splice sites. 
           3. Check if you can annotate UTRs, for example using RNA-Seq data. A useful track that could help with this is the “Combined RNA-Seq plot”. This track combines all RNA-Seq plots available for your genome of interest. You can find this track by searching for “combine”.   
           4. Check sequence similarity by running blast. Right click on the gene in the User-created Annotations area, open the drop down menu and select “Get sequence”. Copy the sequence to the clipboard and run [blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

  question: "Which evidence code should be used when adding GO terms or gene products in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. IDA is used if the GO term/product has been experimentally verified
           2. ISS: GO term/product is inferred from similarity. For GO annotations add GO_REF:0000024 as reference. GO references describe the methods and procedures used in creating such annotations.
           3. ISM: GO term/product is inferred from InterPro/Pfam domain. Add GO_REF:000011 in the reference field for GO annotations.
           4. IMP: GO term/product is inferred from mutant phenotype
           Additional information on evidence codes can be found here: [Guide to GO evidence codes](http://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes)

  question: "How do I add a new gene model in Apollo based on a BLAST match?"
  answer: |
           1. Log into VEuPathDB
           2. Select on the right-hand side the tab “Search”, choose “Blat nucleotide” or “Blat protein” from the drop-down menu and paste in the sequence. Select the tick box ”All genome sequences” if you want to search all chromosomes/contigs of your genome of interest. Click on ”Search”. 
           3. Double-click on the search results to go to the corresponding genome region. The area is shown in yellow. 
           4. If you want to create a gene model based on the search result, click on ”Action” and select ”Create annotation”.

  question: "What happens to my annotations in Apollo?"
  answer: |
           1. Once you are happy with your annotation select the status “Finished” in the Annotation panel.
           2. Within 24 hours product descriptions that have been added to the tab gene product in Apollo will be shown on the gene record page in the Annotation, curation and identifiers section.
           3. The gene model will appear on the live site on the gene record page in the community annotations track in JBrowse.
           4. The annotations will remain in Apollo indefinitely or until they are incorporated into the main gene record.

  question: "How can I programmatically download genome files?"
  answer: |
          There are several options to programmatically (command line) access and download genome files from our servers.
           <p>Examples below are for FungiDB genome, <a href="https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/">Spombe972h.</a> </p>
           <p>You can use wget and the url as the path.  For example:</p>
           <p>wget</p>
           <p>https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/fasta/data/FungiDB-55_Spombe972h_Genome.fasta</p>  
           <p>To find the correct file URL visit Data > Download data file</p>
           <p>Note you can use “Current_Release” or find older versions in the respective folder. </p>
           <img style="width:45em" src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/programaticallydownloadgenomefile.png"  />
           <p>Alternatively, lftp works so you can (after finding the correct directory as in above) use: </p>
           <p>lftp</p>
           <p>https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/</p>
           <p>and then use a command such as:</p>
           <p>mget fasta/data/*</p>
           <p>Or</p>
           <p>mget gff/data/*</p>
           <p>to get all files in that folder.</p>
