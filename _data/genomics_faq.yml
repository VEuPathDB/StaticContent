  question: "How do I do an enrichment analysis on a list of genes by GO term or metabolic pathway?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy: [a list of genes you submit](/a/app/static-content/faq.html#listgenesinterest) or [all the genes in a given organism](/a/app/static-content/faq.html#allgenesorganism)
           1. click “Analyze results"
           This will give you the option to run a variety of analyses on your list of genes
           See the following worksheet to learn more: [GO enrichment](https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/GO-Enrichment.pdf)

  question: "How do I transform a list of genes into homologs in a different organism?"
  answer: |
           Start with a list of genes using an existing strategy: [a list of genes you submit](/a/app/static-content/faq.html#listgenesinterest) or [all the genes in a given organism](/a/app/static-content/faq.html#allgenesorganism)
           1. Click "Add a step"
           2. Choose "Transform"
           3. Click "Orthologs"
           4. Locate the species/strain that you want to transform your list of genes, into and tick it
           5. Click "Run Step"
           You will now have a list of genes in the new species (A) and corresponding list of homologue(s) in the input species (B).

  question: "How to cite a gene? Why we recomend gene stable ID in addition to gene metadata"
  answer: |
           Gene metadata are the gene name or symbol and the gene functional description. The gene stable IDs are, not only stable (as implied by their name), also easier to work with, as you can upload them in GLORIA WORK IN PROFGRESS ...

  question: "How do I download a sequence in FASTA format from a region of interest in JBrowse?"
  answer: |
           1. Make sure the “annotated transcripts” and the “reference sequence” tracks are turned on
           2. Click on the “highlight a region” button in the navigation bar. It should turn yellow when activated
           3. Click and drag in the genome view region and select the area you would like to highlight (tip: highlight region from within annotation track)
           4. Click on the down arrow on the reference sequence track and select “Save track data”
           5. In the next popup window you can keep everything as the default and either save or view the sequence

  question: "How do I add a restriction site to JBrowse?"
  answer: |
           In JBrowse
           1. Select “Add sequence search track” from the Track menu
           2. Enter the enzyme sequence in the popup
           3. The location of the sequence will now show up in the browser.  The cool thing is that you can add multiple tracks with sequences that you define

  question: "Exporting from Galaxy/Globus to VEuPathDB returns a user email not valid error. How can I fix this?"
  answer: |
           This is most likely caused by you having a Galaxy account created outside VEuPathDB.
           To check this, click on “User” from the home page. If the email address listed does not end in “@veupathdb.org”, then you are using a non-VEuPathDB account. This account could have been created through the Globus system.
           If you do not have a “@veupathdb.org” address listed here, our systems will not be able to link your Galaxy account to your VEuPathDB account.

            <img src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_16.png"  />
           

           <p>To fix this, go here: https://app.globus.org/account/identities
           You will likely have a primary identity consisting of your non-VEuPathDB email address:</p>

            <img src="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/assets/images/genomics_faq_images/Picture_genomics_17.png"  />

           <p>If so, you need to unlink your VEuPathDB account from your other account by selecting ‘Manage Identities’ and pressing the Trash icon next to your VEuPathDB user name. This will not delete the VEuPathDB account, but will remove it from this particular Globus identity. Log out from this Globus identity.</p>
           <p>Then, you must log out of Galaxy. Then log back into Galaxy using your VEuPathDB credentials -- this will likely create a new Galaxy account. Also, this will create a new Globus identity in which your VEuPathDB is the only account and also the primary identity. To verify that this worked, press the User menu in Galaxy and you should see your VEuPathDB user name: for example, mark123456789@veupathdb.org.</p>
           <p>To transfer your work from your old non-VEuPathDB account to your new VEuPathDB account, share your history from the non-VEuPathDB account to the VEuPathDB account. Import the history into your VEuPathDB account.</p>
           <p>Now you can export to our VEuPathDB websites. You should use this particular Galaxy account to do your future VEuPathDB work, so that you can export to VEuPathDB and so that we can contact you with important information about VEuPathDB Galaxy.</p>
