<   question: "How can I programmatically download genome files?"
<   answer: |
<           There are several options to programmatically (command line) access and download genome files from our servers.
<            <p>Examples below are for FungiDB genome, <a href="https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/">Spombe972h.</a> </p>
<            <p>You can use wget and the url as the path.  For example:</p>
<            <p>wget</p>
<            <p>https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/fasta/data/FungiDB-55_Spombe972h_Genome.fasta</p>  
<            <p>To find the correct file URL visit Data > Download data file</p>
<            <p>Note you can use “Current_Release” or find older versions in the respective folder. </p>

<            <p>Alternatively, lftp works so you can (after finding the correct directory as in above) use: </p>
<            <p>lftp</p>
<            <p>https://fungidb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Spombe972h/</p>
<            <p>and then use a command such as:</p>
<            <p>mget fasta/data/*</p>
<            <p>Or</p>
<            <p>mget gff/data/*</p>
<            <p>to get all files in that folder.</p>
