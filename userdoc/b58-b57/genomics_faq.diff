<   question: "What genomes are available for community annotation in Apollo?"
<   answer: |
<            1. Reference genomes are available in Apollo. Reference genome indicates the genome used by VEuPathDB as the reference sequence to which other data sets are mapped. 
<            2. Genomes from HostDB are not available for community curation in Apollo.
<            3. Other exceptions include genomes that are curated at Model Organism Databases, for instance <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> S288C. 
<            4. Is your genome of interest not available for community annotation? Please [contact us](https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/contact-us).

<            4. The annotations will remain in Apollo indefinitely or until they are incorporated into the main gene record.
