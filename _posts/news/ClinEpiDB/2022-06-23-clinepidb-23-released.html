    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We've made it easier than ever to find studies and variables of interest! No matter where you are on ClinEpiDB, you can use the search bar in the header to search for a term of interest. This search will return <i>Studies</i> that contain the term in their name or description, <i>Variables</i> that contain the term in their variable name, definition, or other metadata, and <i>Variable values</i> that contain the term as part of the value label for a variable. Each result contains links that take you directly to the study, variable, or value of interest! For example, a search for <i>Variables</i> that include "Giardia TAC" returns a number of variables, and the top hit is a variable, <i>Giardia, by TAC result</i>, that is present in 3 different studies, GEMS1, MAL-ED, and PROVIDE.</li>
      <li>The map visualization tool released two months ago now supports continuous variables &mdash; such as age and infection intensity &mdash; in addition to categorical variables. For instance, see how ~75% of those enrolled in the SCORE Seasonal S. haematobium Cluster Randomized Trial were children under the age of 14 across sites. Switch between pie plot and bar chart views of the data based on your preference.</li>
      <li>We have improved the experience of downloading a fully customizable subset of data. The new modal allows you to easily create a table with columns for specific variables you are interested in. Once your table is configured, you can preview and download it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_40a4b145f4">Preventing Congenital Syphilis Cluster Randomized Trial</a> was conducted in over 54,000 women in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Lusaka, Zambia at 26 antenatal care clinics. The study aimed to determine if behavioral interventions, randomized at the clinic level, improved screening and treatment of syphilis at the first antenatal care visit. The dataset contains variables on obstetric history and Syphilis treatments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>General Information</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conferences - We recently attended the SER meeting in Chicago and the ISPPD meeting in Toronto and had a great time representing ClinEpiDB, learning about new studies, and promoting our tools for use by teachers and students in addition to researchers. If you know of other conferences we should attend, please shoot us an email at help@clinepidb.org. The next conference we plan to attend in person is ASTMH in Oct-Nov 2022 in Seattle.</li>
      <li>Webinars - We have been presenting webinars to a number of researchers over the past few months including to groups in Thailand, South Africa, Uganda, the UK, and the US, as well as globally distributed groups. If you have a departmental seminar or class where you would like us to give a presentation on what people can do with ClinEpiDB, please reach out to help@clinepidb.org! As part of our outreach efforts, we have created a <30 minute video (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH69Caozt74">How to access and explore data from ClinEpiDB.org: A guide for students</a>) aimed at students interested in accessing data via ClinEpiDB, which we can pair with live Q&A sessions for your class.</li>
