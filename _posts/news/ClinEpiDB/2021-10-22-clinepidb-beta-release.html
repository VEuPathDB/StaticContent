    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A fresh new layout - An intuitive new layout lets you easily switch between viewing study info, browsing and subsetting data, and making plots and tables. And we save your place in each tab! At the top of the page, a diagram shows you how the data is structured, and the amount of data for each major group of variables.</li>
      <li>Featured variables - Looking at a new study? The featured variables section highlights key variables for you to help you get started.</li>
      <li>Starred variables - Star your favorite variables to access them more easily! This short list of variables can be used in the browse and subset tab and when making plots and tables in the visualize tab.</li>
      <li>Browse and Subset tab - Create a subset of study data the way you're used to, by applying variable filters. As you create your subset, see the impact of filtering across the entire dataset by checking out the diagram at the top of the page!</li>
      <li>Visualize tab - With new visualization tools, you can make histograms, bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, 2x2 contingency tables, and mosaic plots for RxC contingency tables. You can also stratify by another variable. If you update your subset, no worries, your visualizations will update too when you reopen them.</li>
    </ul>
