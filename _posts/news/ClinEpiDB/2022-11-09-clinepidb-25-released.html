    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When plotting data using our tools, the range of the axes is determined by the complete dataset. This can create frustration if you are only plotting a subset of the data and it is clumped together on one side of the plot. We therefore added a feature to make it easy to zoom in to your data subset! To take advantage of this feature, look for the axis controls below the plot and choose Auto-zoom.

    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_f3ce0be2f1">Myanmar ICEMR Malaria Cohort</a> enrolled 2700 participants in Myanmar and along its borders with China and Bangladesh and followed them for 4 weeks if uninfected with Plasmodium at baseline and 12 weeks if infected. The study assessed the dynamics of subclinical malaria, detected by ultrasensitive PCR, as well as the association between risk factors like occupation and travel with infection status. </li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_4d72506014">Asia Pacific ICEMR Cambodian Cross-sectional</a> study enrolled 10,393 participants in Cambodia. The study aimed to characterize regional demographic and geographic determinants of infection and determine the prevalence of antibodies. Data on risk factors like travel history and bednet usage are available alongside antibody titers for different Plasmodium proteins.</li>

    <h3><b>Recent Events</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In connection with the ASTMH (Trop Med) meeting in Seattle, we ran a 5 hour workshop on October 30 entitled Introduction to Data Sharing and Data Exploration on the ClinEpiDB Platform. In this workshop, attendees learned the benefits and challenges of FAIR data access and how ontological mapping supports meta-analysis, and received hands-on training on ClinEpiDB's tools to efficiently identify, explore, visualize, and download data of interest. You can access all the slides and exercises on our <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/static-content/ClinEpiDB/workshops.html">Workshops</a> page and <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> if you have any questions.
