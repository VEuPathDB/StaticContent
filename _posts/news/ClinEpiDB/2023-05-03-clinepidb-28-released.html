    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_450c62c7d0/new/details">Jilinde Costing Study of PrEP in Kenya</a> was conducted in order to help the government of Kenya to better understand the cost of scaling up oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). It assessed the cost of PrEP for various Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs) using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya. From October 2017 to August 2018, 1890 participants were surveyed from the service delivery perspective and the client perspective in Kenya.</li>

    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Just like journal articles must be properly credited, so too should the data itself. Dataset citations give the study team credit for collecting and sharing the original data and allow teams to measure and track the impact of their investigations. Additionally, citing data helps ensure reproducibility of secondary analyses, increasing transparency. Citations enable other researchers to locate and access datasets more easily to maximize reuse. We have made it even easier to appropriately cite datasets downloaded from ClinEpiDB. The “Download” tab of every study now includes “Dataset Citation” information, where you can find details to appropriately reference the latest version of each dataset. Click the button to copy the citation directly to your clipboard. “Dataset Citation” information specific to every previous release of the dataset is also provided, and can be found directly under the header for each version of the full dataset.</li>
