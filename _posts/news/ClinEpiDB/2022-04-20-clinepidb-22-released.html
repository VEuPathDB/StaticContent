    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Now you can create line plots to explore  data over time! You can look at proportions of your favorite categorical variable and mean or median values of a continuous variable over time. For example, look at Schistosoma mansoni prevalence (i.e, the proportion of positive/(positive+negative) tests by microscopy) over the course of one of the SCORE studies.</li>
      <li>Use the new map visualization tool to look at the geographic distribution of data. At the moment, this tool supports categorical variables. Zoom in and out of the map and watch as the markers disaggregate and aggregate, respectively, to make it easier to look across regions. Check back in future releases as we add the ability to look at continuous variables.</li>
      <li>We have added the ability to adjust the axis range on plots like histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, and line plots. This means you can zoom in to take a closer look at a specific area of the plot!</li>
    </ul>
