    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_a05cff61da/new/details">Bangladesh Cryptosporidium Cohort</a> was a prospective observational study of rural and slum-dwelling children to determine the incidence and contribution to disease of the different species and genotypes of cryptosporidia. Starting in June 2014, 758 mothers and their newborn babies were enrolled at the household level and followed to 4 years of life initially but extended through 7 years of age on a subset of children. Trained field research assistants conducted bi-weekly home surveillance to measure the incidence, duration and severity of Cryptosporidium primary infections. Diarrheal stools and monthly surveillance stools were worked up for Cryptosporidium.</li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_556c2b1149/new/details">BetterBirth Cluster Randomized Trial</a> was conducted from 2014 t0 2016 in 120 health facilities in India. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist and peer-coaching on birth attendantsâ€™ adherence to 28 essential birth practices, perinatal mortality and maternal mortality and severe morbidity. Women were enrolled at delivery and followed up once. Data was collected about implementation and attitudes towards the checklist and availability of supplies in clinics repeatedly over the course of the study.</li>
      <li>MAL-ED data on ClinEpiDB.org and MicrobiomeDB.org: 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 2 microbiome studies on MicrobiomeDB.org can now be analyzed in the context of the vast breadth of clinical and epidemiological data available on ClinEpiDB from the <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_5c41b87221/new/details">MAL-ED 0-60m cohort study</a>! The <a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/workspace/analyses/DS_72c94486c6/new/details">MAL-ED 0-2yr microbiome sub-study</a> restricted analyses to monthly stool samples collected between birth and 2 years of age; 50 participants at 4 sites (Peru, India, Brazil, and South Africa) were selected as a 'healthy' cohort, as defined by height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores. The <a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/workspace/analyses/DS_2e56313a65/new/details">The MAL-ED diarrhea microbiome sub-study</a> investigated the impact of enteric infections on the microbiome in a birth cohort of 271 children with a high burden of diarrhea and stunting in Peru, with samples collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age.
