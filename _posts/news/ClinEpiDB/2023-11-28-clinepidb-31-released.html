    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_a83d9defbb/new/details">Southern Africa ICEMR Cross-sectional study</a> was a serial cross-sectional study of malaria in different transmission settings (high, low, and seasonal) conducted in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Households were randomly surveyed from 2012- 2022, and all participants within a household were eligible for enrollment. Standardized survey instruments were used to collect data on demographic characteristics, general knowledge of malaria (transmission, prevention, and treatment), malaria treatment history and health seeking behavior, recent travel history, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and socio-economic indicators. Finger-prick blood specimens were collected from enrolled children and adults.</li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_08b80ee6ae/new/details">Amazonia ICEMR2- Brazil Rio Azul study</a> was conducted in 2018 and 2019 to investigate the epidemiology of malaria transmission in riverine communities in Rio Azul, Acre, Brazil. Data was collected from participants from 10 villages along the Azul River using a structured questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and morbidity information and participants were invited to provide a finger-prick blood sample for malaria diagnosis using microscopy and genus-specific PCR tests, and hemoglobin measurement.</li>

    <h3><b>New Feature: MapVEu Interactive Map tool</b></h3>
    ClinEpiDB now offers geospatial visualization of categorical and continuous variables with our new MapVEu Interactive Map tool, currently available on ClinEpiDB as a beta version. The Interactive Map provides full-screen map view of your analysis and can be accessed from DIY-uploaded “My studies” as long as the data file contains separate columns labeled “Latitude” and “Longitude”, or from the following curated studies (more studies providing geographic coordinates are coming soon): 
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazonia ICEMR2- Brazil Rio Azul</li>
      <li>Asia Pacific ICEMR Cambodian Cross-sectional</li>
      <li>SCORE <i>S. mansoni</i> Cluster Randomized Trial</li>
      <li>SCORE Mozambique <i>S. haematobium</i> Cluster Randomized Trial</li>
      <li>SCORE Niger <i>S. haematobium</i> Cluster Randomized Trial</li>
      <li>SCORE Seasonal Transmission <i>S. haematobium</i> Cluster Randomized Trial</li>
    </p>
    Whenever you open an analysis for a dataset that includes geographic coordinates, you can easily navigate between the standard ClinEpiDB view and the Interactive Map view by clicking “Explore in Interactive Map” or “Explore in ClinEpiDB”. Note that ClinEpiDB and the Interactive Map provide different views of the same analysis; filters applied to the dataset in one view will also apply to the dataset in the other view. 
  </p>
    Data filtering, data downloads, and sharing of filter and visualization settings to other researchers are all part of the tool. Supplementary plots made from within the Interactive Map will respond to your navigation interactions with the map. For example, move the visible map area to compare <i>S. mansoni</i> prevalence over time in different locations.
  </p>
    A tutorial for using the Interactive Map can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/clinEpi/clinEpi_exercises/Interactive_Map_tutorial_ClinEpiDB_20231127.pdf">here</a>. This is a Beta version of the Interactive Map so please email us at help@clinepidb.org if you encounter any bugs or confusion!
