    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH): PERCH used a case-control design to characterize the etiologic distribution of pathogens causing severe pneumonia among children under 5 years of age who had been hospitalized for their illness in seven countries in Asia and Africa (Bangladesh, Thailand, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, and Zambia). 4232 cases and 5119 community controls were enrolled between 2011 to 2014. The merged <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_1595200bb8/new/variables/PCO_0000024/EUPATH_0021094">PERCH</a> dataset can be used to explore aggregate data from all seven countries concurrently on the ClinEpiDB website, but users must submit separate requests to download individual-level datasets from each country. Seven separate country-specific PERCH datasets have been made available on ClinEpiDB to facilitate data access requests.</li>
      <li>PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort: The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_17191d35b9">PRISM2 ICEMR Border Cohort</a> was a prospective dynamic cohort study comparing temporal changes in malaria incidence, prevalence, and entomological measures. A cohort of 667 residents living in two areas within Tororo District and in neighboring Busia District was enrolled between September 2020 and September 2023. The study found that dramatic resurgence of malaria in Tororo was temporally associated with a change to clothianidin-based IRS formulations and emergence of An. funestus as the predominant vector. Malaria decreased after a shift back to IRS with Actellic. This study highlights the ability of malaria vectors to rapidly circumvent control efforts and the importance of high-quality surveillance systems to assess the impact of malaria control interventions and generate timely, actionable data. This study has not yet been integrated into ClinEpiDB’s online analysis workspace, but data files are available for download.</li>

    <h3><b>New Feature: Upload and release your own study data!</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li> You are now in the driver’s seat: You can now manage the release of your own study data on ClinEpiDB! After you have uploaded your dataset privately to “My Studies” (under the Workspace menu in the site header), just select any studies you own from the My Studies table and click the “Manage Access” button in the upper right. From here, you can choose to share the dataset with a select group of individuals or broadly with the ClinEpiDB Community. Please note that any study data with Community Access is immediately accessible from the Studies menu in the site header and downloadable by anyone who visits ClinEpiDB.</li>
