    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Now you can upload your own data and explore it with all the tools ClinEpiDB has to offer! To get started, go to the <b>Workspace</b> menu in the header and click <b>My User Studies</b>. Then go to the <b>New Upload</b> tab and add your information and file! At the moment, this feature requires that data be in a single comma or tab-delimited text file (.csv, .tsv, or .txt). Once the data are uploaded and installed, which can take up to 2 hours depending on the size of your file, you will be able to access your dataset via the <b>Studies</b> menu and explore and visualize your data just like with any other dataset. Note: Data will only be visible to you unless you choose to share it with another ClinEpiDB user. You can also delete a dataset at any time. Learn more about this new feature on the <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/datasets/help">help page</a>.

    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_8786631aaf">PROMOTE Birth Cohort 3 Randomized Controlled Trial</a> enrolled 782 pregnant women in Uganda and followed them and their infants for 1 year after delivery. The study aimed to compare the risk of adverse birth outcomes and incidence of malaria among HIV-uninfected pregnant women randomized to receive IPTp with monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) vs dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). The dataset contains data on pregnancy, labor, and delivery, clinical data on mothers and infants, treatment information, and lab test results.</li>

The study aimed to evaluate delivery, uptake, and continuation of oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) by key target groups (men who have sex with men [MSM] and female sex workers [FSW]), adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), individuals in HIV sero-discordant relationships and other high-risk individuals in Kenya.</li>
