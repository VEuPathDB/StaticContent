    <h3><b>The new and improved ClinEpiDB platform!</b></h3>
    Our new and improved platform, previously released as beta.clinepidb.org, is now ready for primetime! This redesigned version of ClinEpiDB contains most of the features you are already familiar with, plus a host of new features that make it easier to do exploratory data analysis within your web browser! Check out the <b>New Features</b> section below to learn more. For a few months, you will still be able to access the original ClinEpiDB website, including saved strategies, at <a target="_blank" href="https://legacy.clinepidb.org">legacy.clinepidb.org</a>.

    <h3><b>Workshops and Webinars</b></h3>
    ClinEpiDB is a resource where researchers can explore data shared by others and make their own de-identified data publicly accessible, and where students can access real-world data for use in epidemiology or biostatistics class projects and theses. If you have a departmental seminar or class where you would like us to give a presentation on what people can do with ClinEpiDB, please reach out to help@clinepidb.org! As part of our outreach efforts, we will be creating a 15-20 minute video aimed at students interested in accessing data via ClinEpiDB, which we can pair with live Q&A sessions for your class.

    <h3><b>New Features</b></h3>
    The first six features listed below were previously debuted on beta.clinepidb.org. All eight features mentioned are now accessible on ClinEpiDB!
    <ol>
      <li>A fresh new layout - An intuitive new layout lets you easily switch between viewing study info, browsing and subsetting data, and making plots and tables. And we save your place in each tab! At the top of the page, a diagram shows you the size and structure of the data.</li>
      <li>Featured variables - Looking at a new study? The featured variables section highlights key variables for you to help you get started.</li>
      <li>Starred variables - Star your favorite variables to access them more easily! This short list of variables can be used in the browse and subset tab and when making plots and tables in the visualize tab.</li>
      <li>Browse and Subset tab - Create a subset of study data the way you're used to, by applying variable filters. As you create your subset, see the impact of filtering across the entire dataset by checking out the diagram at the top of the page!</li>
      <li>Visualize tab - You can make histograms, bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, and mosaic plots for 2x2 and RxC contingency tables. You can also stratify by other variables, using overlays and facets. If you update your subset, no worries, your visualizations will automatically update when you reopen them. Check out this example where <i>Weight-for-age-z-score</i> is faceted by the Country of the study site.</li>
      <li>Record Notes tab - If you open a study, there's a helpful new Record Notes tab where you can jot down your hypothesis, reminders about specific variables, plans to subset the data, interpretation of graphs, etc. Notes will be automatically saved as part of your analysis.</li>
      <li>Download tab - From the Download tab, you can download either complete data files for a study, or configure download files that contain only the subset of data and variables you are interested in.</li>
      <li>Share an analysis or make it public - If you subset the data within a study, create any visualizations, or add any notes, you can choose to share your analysis or make it publicly accessible. To share your analysis, click the "Share analysis" button, and you will generate a link that you can send to anyone. To make an analysis public, go to the "My analyses" page, find the analysis you want to make public, and click the checkbox.</li>
    </ol>
