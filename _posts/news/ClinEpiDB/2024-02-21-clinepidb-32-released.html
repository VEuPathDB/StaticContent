    <h3><b>New Data</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NECTAR (4 studies): The NECTAR datasets represent data from four malaria control trials in Mali. The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_7b47eb7469/new/details">NECTAR1 trial</a> evaluated the efficacy of pyronaridine–artesunate and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with and without single low-dose primaquine for reducing gametocyte density and transmission to mosquitoes. The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_03d6476c6d/new/details">NECTAR2 trial</a> evaluated single low dose tafenoquine to reduce <i>P. falciparum</i> transmission. The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_d00683a135/new/details">NECTAR3 trial</a> is a four-arm trial comparing artemether-lumefantrine with or without single-dose primaquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/amodiaquine with or without single-dose tafenoquine to reduce <i>P. falciparum transmission</i>. The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_861ea66681/new/details">NECTAR4 trial</a> is a five-arm trial comparing artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine with or without single-dose primaquine to reduce <i>P. falciparum</i> transmission.</li>
      <li>LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project 2: The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_624583e93e/new/details">LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project 2 (LLINEUP2)</a> was a cluster-randomized trial embedded in the Ugandan National Malaria Control Program’s 2020-2021 long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) distribution campaign. 64 clusters within 32 districts were randomly assigned to receive LLINs with pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator) or LLINs with piperonyl butoxide (a synergist that inhibits cytochrome P450). Cross-sectional community surveys were conducted at 12 and 24 months following LLIN distribution in 50 randomly selected households per cluster. Parasite prevalence was assessed in ~9,400 children aged 2-10 years.</li>
      <li>LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (additional data added): The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_7c4cd6bba9/new/details">LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP)</a> was a cluster-randomized trial embedded in the Ugandan National Malaria Control Program’s 2017-2018 long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) distribution campaign. 104 health sub-districts were randomly assigned to receive LLINs with piperonyl butoxide (a synergist) or conventional LLINs. Cross-sectional surveys were performed in 5200 households per timepoint to assess parasite prevalence in children. Previously, ClinEpiDB only hosted data from the pre-intervention baseline, and timepoints 6, 12, and 18 months after LLIN distribution. In this release, data from 25 months after LLIN distribution is now also available.</li>
      <li>ELICIT Randomized Controlled Trial (additional data added): The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_6834a4c83b/new/details">Early Life Interventions for Childhood Growth and Development in Tanzania (ELICIT)</a> randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of antimicrobials (azithromycin and nitazoxanide) and nicotinamide in increasing length-for-age z-score in a 2x2 factorial trial in Tanzania. This release adds quantitative PCR data for 34 pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes, performed on 5,479 stool samples with a customized TAC card.</li>

    <h3><b>New Feature: Clickable markers added to Interactive Map tool</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Full-screen geospatial visualization of data from studies providing geographic coordinates is now possible with our Interactive Map tool. Supplementary plots made from within the Interactive Map will respond to your navigation interactions with the map. You can now click to select particular map markers of interest; once markers have been selected, the supplementary plots will visualize only data corresponding to your markers of interest. Shift-click to select multiple map markers!</li>
