    <ul>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_0086998c2f/new/variables/EUPATH_0035127/EUPATH_0044124">Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE)</a> Cluster Randomized Trial is a trial set in Zimbabwe that aimed to determine the independent and combined effects of improved household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on stunting and anemia in young children. Pregnant women were enrolled in the study and randomized into 1 of 4 arms (standard of care, IYCF, WASH, and combined IYCF+WASH). Their children were followed from birth to 18 months. </li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_def666ebb5/new/variables/EUPATH_0043226/EUPATH_0050010">MORDOR Cluster Randomized Trial</a> in Niger is a community-level cluster-randomized, placebo controlled trial designed to evaluate the role of mass drug treatment with azithromycin as an intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and mortality. 594 communities were randomized to azithromycin or placebo arms and children aged 1-59 months were treated every 6 months for 2 years.</li>
      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_be1995b20b/new/variables/EUPATH_0000096/EUPATH_0015457">India ICEMR DAMaN Study</a> is a cluster-assigned quasi-experimental stepped-wedge study with a pretest-posttest control group. It was conducted in Odisha, India to evaluate if malaria camps reduce the prevalence of malaria compared to villages receiving the usual malaria control interventions (e.g. IRS, ITNs). Village residents aged 1-69 years old were enrolled, and surveys were conducted over 4 time periods.</li>
      <li>MAL-ED data on ClinEpiDB.org and MicrobiomeDB.org: 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 2 microbiome studies on MicrobiomeDB.org can now be analyzed in the context of the vast breadth of clinical and epidemiological data available on ClinEpiDB from the <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_5c41b87221/new/details">MAL-ED 0-60m cohort study</a>! The <a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/record/dataset/DS_9d44f0a9b5">MAL-ED 0-2yr microbiome sub-study</a> restricted analyses to monthly stool samples collected between birth and 2 years of age; 50 participants at 4 sites (Peru, India, Brazil, and South Africa) were selected as a 'healthy' cohort, as defined by height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores. The <a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomedb.org/mbio/app/record/dataset/DS_71c725321c">MAL-ED diarrhea microbiome sub-study</a> investigated the impact of enteric infections on the microbiome in a birth cohort of 271 children with a high burden of diarrhea and stunting in Peru, with samples collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. To get started, download data files containing your variables of interest from ClinEpiDB.org and MicrobiomeDB.org. Data can be easily merged together as the same participant and sample identifiers are used across all files.</li>
