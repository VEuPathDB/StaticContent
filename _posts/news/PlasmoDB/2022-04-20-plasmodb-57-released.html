  <h3>New features in {{project}} 57</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>BLAST Tool Improvements</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="/a/app/workspace/blast/new">BLAST (multi-query capable)</a> tool, known previously as BLAST<i>beta</i>, can perform queries with one or more FASTA-formatted sequences and offers many download types. The tool uses NCBI BLAST to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence. BLAST (multi-query capable) is <a href="{{'/assets/images/Find-blast-tool.png' | absolute_url}}">available from the tools menu.</a></li>
    <li>A new download option, <a href="{{'/assets/images/BLAST-This-table-download.png' | absolute_url}}">'This table (csv)'</a>, for the results of multi-sequence queries (combined result) retrieves the {{project}} result table for the results of multi-sequence queries (combined result). </li>
    <li><a href="{{'/assets/images/BLAST-56-improvements.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Gene page sequence highlighting</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Genomic and mRNA sequences on gene pages have a new color scheme.  Introns are highlighted in yellow and UTR sequence are highlighted in pink.  Previously they were gray and blue, respectively. <a href="{{'/assets/images/gene-seq-highlight.png' | absolute_url}}">Example</a></li>

    <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
