  <h3>New features in {{project}} 58</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>New 'Unannotated Intron Junctions' Search</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The new <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByIntronJunctions">Unannotated Intron Junctions</a> search enables users to identify genes that contain, or are flanked by, unannotated high confidence intron junction-spanning reads from RNA-seq data. These genes may be incompletely or inaccurately annotated due to missing introns/exons and/or alternative splice variants.  The search is categorized under Search for Genes, Function Prediction.  See our <a href="{{'/documents/Intron_junctions_search_16_04_2022.pdf' | absolute_url}}">PDF Tutorial</a> or our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kjjsB3eqxA" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a> for more information. </li>

    <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
