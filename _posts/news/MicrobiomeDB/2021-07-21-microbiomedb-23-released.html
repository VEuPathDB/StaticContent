        <li>The Anopheles albimanus 16S microbiome study assessed the impact of pyrethroid exposure on the internal and cuticle microbiome.  A. albimanus is one of the main insect vectors responsible for transmission of malaria in Central America, northern South America, and the Carribean. 
        </li><li>The Baby Observational and Nutrition Study (BONUS) includes shotgun metagenomic data from over 1200 samples collected longitudinally from infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis during newborn screening, or healthy controls.  The goal of this study was to understand the extent to which the microbiome in infants with CF is linked to poor growth in the first year of life.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
