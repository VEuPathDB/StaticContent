        <h3><b>New data in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>This release includes 93 new shotgun metagenomic studies comprising over 22,000 samples that were curated as part of the curatedMetagenoicData project (PMID: 29088129) and R package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/curatedMetagenomicData.html).  These studies are the first to be shared on our site as 'Community studies'.  You can read more about this feature below.

        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Community studies - Any private dataset uploaded to the site can now be 'published' for access by anyone on MicrobiomeDB.org as a 'Community study'.  Any data uploaded by a user through the 'My studies' page is private by default.  Only you and people that you choose to share with can view this data.  However, we have introduced a new feature that allows any user to share their data (published or unpublished) with all users of our site.  To do this, you can convert a private dataset to a 'Community' study with the click of a button.  At any time, the original owner of community study can choose to revoke community access, which will revert the dataset back to private status.  Community studies can be queried and visualized in the same way as curated studies, but are not represented on the homepage as study cards.
        </li><li>Self-correlation app - We're excited to continue our recent trend of creating new and innovative correlation apps for visualizing microbiome data.  Our new network app allows users to visualize taxa-taxa relationships to identify co-associated taxa.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
