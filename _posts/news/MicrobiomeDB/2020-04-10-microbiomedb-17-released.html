        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>There was a site-wide switch from using the Greengenes reference 16S database, to using Silva.  As a consequence, many more taxa have been identified from the studies loaded on our site.
        </li>
        <li>A 'Select a Category' dropdown menu was added to the main page and a color coded category tag has been added to the upper right-hand corner of each study card.  This allows users to quickly filter study cards to display only those that match the category selected (e.g. human, mouse, veterinary, etc).

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
