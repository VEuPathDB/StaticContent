        <h3><b>New data in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Preterm Infant Resistome II (WGS) profiled the stool metagenome in 41 preterm infants (born less than 33 weeks gestational age) and 17 antibiotic-naive, healthy early term or late-preterm infants.  Infants were profiled throughout the first 21 months of life, and stratified by antibiotic use during their hospitalization.
        </li><li>The Uganda Maternal microbiome study profiled the V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S rRNA regions in vaginal samples obtained from ~100 Ugandan pregnant women during active labor but before birth. Patients were catergorizd by intrapartum fever status.

        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Our data loading workflow has been improved to include automated detection of eukaryotes in shotgun metagenomic data.  This allows all metagenomic studies on our site to be queried for the presence of eukaryotic microbes (e.g. fungi, protists, etc.).  You can read more about this new feature in our FAQs.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
