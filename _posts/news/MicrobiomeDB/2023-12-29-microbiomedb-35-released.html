        <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Two new analysis and visualization tools for correlations:
        </li><li> A new app was developted that allows users to build and visualize bipartite correlation networks to identify relationships between taxonomic abundance data or functional metagenomic/metabolomic data and sample or patient metadata.  You can use this tool to find taxa, pathways, or metabolites linked with a study covariate of interest.
        </li><li> A separate bipartite network app was developted that allows users to visualize correlations between taxonomic abundance data and functional metagenomic data, such as pathway abundance.  This allows users to quickly and easily identify taxa-function relationships in complex metagenomic studies.
        </li><li> Both correlations apps described above come with a new collapsable 'explainer' that helps users understand the inputs, results, statistical choices that factor into these types of network analyses.
        </li><li> Users can now download a .png or .svg file, with the click of a button, for any plot produced in MicrobiomeDB.

           <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When sample IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
