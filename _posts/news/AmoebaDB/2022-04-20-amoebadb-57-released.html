  <h3>New data in {{project}} 57</h3> 
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Genome Sequence and Annotation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_140a09e816"><i>Naegleria fowleri</i> Ty</a> &ndash; Isolated from a 1969 primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) patient from Virginia, this organism belongs to genotype III. The genome sequences were assembled from Illumina HiSeq and PacBio sequencing data and verified with the optical mapping data for the identification of 37 contigs representing 37 chromosomes.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858935" target="_blank"> Ali et al. 2021</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378985" target="_blank"> Joseph et al. 2021</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Community Annotations Updated</h4>
    We are pleased to announce the first update for an AmoebaDB genome through Apollo, a web-based genomic annotation editing platform. Changes in the genome annotation that were entered into Apollo by AmoebaDB users were reviewed by VEuPathDB annotation staff and transferred from Apollo into the VEuPathDB annotation track.  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_6f78904013"><i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> NEFF</a> &ndash; We incorporated 180 changes, including creation of new genes, modification of existing genes, merges and splits. See a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IipM-c9D2VRBfVlfUFGrdft8zKQZzBEoiGxGw3RoXME/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">breakdown of the changes and the data incorporated</a>.</li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 57</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>New 'Unannotated Intron Junctions' Search</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The new <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByIntronJunctions">Unannotated Intron Junctions</a> search enables users to identify genes that contain, or are flanked by, unannotated high confidence intron junction-spanning reads from RNA-seq data. These genes may be incompletely or inaccurately annotated due to missing introns/exons and/or alternative splice variants.  The search is categorized under Search for Genes, Function Prediction.  See our <a href="https://qa.static-content.veupathdb.org/documents/Intron_junctions_search_16_04_2022.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Tutorial</a> or our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kjjsB3eqxA" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a> for more information. </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
