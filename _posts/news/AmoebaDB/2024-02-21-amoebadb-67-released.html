    We invite all users to engage with Apollo, where you can actively edit and enhance your selected genes. Whether you're a seasoned user or a newcomer, our updated <a href="/a/app/static-content/apollo_help.html">Apollo landing page</a> provides a wealth of resources, including links to on-demand webinars, tutorials, and annotation guidelines. <br><br>
    Every edit you make contributes significantly! This open invitation is extended to all users, with a special emphasis on scientists studying groups of organisms that have recently been updated to integrate new reference genomes, and for the species that are now accessible on {{project}} for the first time. If you're unfamiliar or have any questions, don't hesitate to <a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a>. We're here to help!

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
