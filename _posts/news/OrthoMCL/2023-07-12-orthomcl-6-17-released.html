OrthoMCL Version 6.17 is released. In this release, 15 <b>Peripheral</b> organisms were added. Thus, OrthoMCL now predicts orthology for a total of 826 organisms (676 <b>Peripheral</b> and 150 <b>Core</b> organisms). Proteins from the 15 new organisms were mapped into <b>Core</b> ortholog groups. Then, a new set of <b>Residual</b> ortholog groups (e.g. OG6r17_129716) were formed from the collection of all unmapped <b>Peripheral</b> proteins. See the <a href="/a/app/static-content/OrthoMCL/about.html">About page</a> for the methods.
