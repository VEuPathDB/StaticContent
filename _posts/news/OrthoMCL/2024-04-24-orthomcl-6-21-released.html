title: OrthoMCL 6.21 released
category: [OrthoMCL,VEuPathDB]
---

<p>OrthoMCL Version 6.21 is released. In this release, 16 <b>Peripheral</b> organisms were added. Thus, OrthoMCL now predicts orthology for a total of 857 organisms (707 <b>Peripheral</b> and 150 <b>Core</b> organisms). Proteins from the 16 new organisms were mapped into <b>Core</b> ortholog groups. Then, a new set of <b>Residual</b> ortholog groups were formed from the collection of all unmapped <b>Peripheral</b> proteins. See the <a href="/a/app/static-content/OrthoMCL/about.html">About page</a> for the methods.
</p>

<p>For OrthoMCL build 6.21, the <a href="https://veupathdbprod.globusgenomics.org/" target="_blank">Galaxy workflow</a> that maps user proteomes to OrthoMCL groups has been updated, replacing NCBI BLASTP with Diamond blastp. Diamond has approximately 99.8% of the sensitivity of Blast, but runs 1000-fold faster.  Jobs that took 4-12 hours with BLAST, can now run in 2-10 minutes. The output from the new workflow is identical in format to the BLAST based workflow. The original BLAST workflow is still available.</p>
