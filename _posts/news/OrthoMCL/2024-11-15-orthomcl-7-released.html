<p>OrthoMCL Version 7 is released as a beta version!</p>
    
<p>Important changes and new features in OrthoMCL-7:
    <ul>
      <li>In a major departure from 20+ previous OrthoMCL DB releases, Core orthogroups have now been completely rebuilt with <b>OrthoFinder</b> and have been assigned new orthogroup IDs. The OrthoFinder algorithm uses DIAMOND for much faster BLAST analysis, improves normalization of BLAST scores, and includes phylogenetic information to improve clustering.</li>
      <li>All core proteomes have been refreshed with current (June 2024) UniProt annotation for each species.</li>
      <li>All duplicated "old" genomes have been removed.</li>
      <li>Orthogroup web pages now include a <b>phylogenetic tree</b> of all proteins, which can be customized to include only specific organisms, Pfam groups, or words in protein descriptions.</li>
      <li>Orthogroup web pages now include <b>Similar Groups</b>, which can identify large super-families of related proteins.</li>
      <li><b>Map Proteins to OrthoMCL</b> service is now part of the orthomcl.org website and BLAST results will be saved in a private user workspace.</li>
   </ul>
