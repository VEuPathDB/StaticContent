<p>OrthoMCL Version 7 is released as a beta version!</p>
    
<p>Important changes and new features in OrthoMCL-7:
    <ul>
        <li>All core proteomes have been refreshed with current (June 2024) UniProt annotation for each species.</li>
        <li>All duplicated "old" genomes have been removed.</li>
        <li>Orthogroups are now clustered with OrthoFinder, which uses DIAMOND for much faster BLAST analysis, improves normalization of BLAST scores, and includes phylogenetic information to improve clustering.</li>
        <li>Orthogroup web pages now include a phylogenetic tree of all proteins, which can be customized to include only specific organisms, Pfam groups, or words in protein descriptions.</li>
        <li>Orthogroup web pages now include Similar Groups, which can identify large super-families of related proteins.</li>
        <li>Map Proteins to OrthoMCL service is now part of the orthomcl.org website and BLAST results will be saved in a private user workspace.</li>
      </ul>
