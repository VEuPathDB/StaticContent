    <ul>
      <li>The Product Descriptions table on gene pages is now called All Product Descriptions and contains product descriptions from all relevant sources. The most commonly used product description also appears at the top of the gene page. </li>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByText">Text Search</a> 'Fields' parameter values have changed. Choose 'Product descriptions (all)' to search the All Product Descriptions table on gene pages.  Choose 'Product descriptions' to search only the commonly used product descriptions that appear at the top of gene pages.  </li>
      <li>The Organisms parameter in the <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByNgsSnps">Identify Genes based on SNP Characteristics</a> search has a new look. Choose your organism of interest to load the Set of Samples parameter with that organism's WGS isolates.</li>
      <li>Compressed files in the <a href="/a/app/downloads">Download Data Files</a> tool are now in .gz format.</li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
