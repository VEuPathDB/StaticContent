  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  
  <h4>{{project}} site search accesses Apollo data</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Gene annotation updates entered in <a target="_blank" href="/a/app/static-content/apollo_help.html">{{project}} Apollo</a> are now indexed and available to the site search.  Genes with Apollo annotations that contain your search term will be available in site search results under >Genes >Filter gene fields.</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Single Cell RNA Seq</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Something here <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/UploadListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h4>AlphaFold data available</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein structure predictions from <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaFold</a> are now available in {{project}}.  The AlphaFold database was downloaded and structures were associated to {{project}} genes via the UniProt ID. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265844/" target="_blank">Jumper et al. 2021</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34791371/" target="_blank">Varadi et al. 2022</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesWithAlphafold">AlphaFold search</a> returns all genes with AlphaFold predictions in {{project}}.</li>
      <li>Gene pages include a table of AlphaFold data and the AlphaFold 3D viewer for dynamic visualization of the predicted structure. </li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
