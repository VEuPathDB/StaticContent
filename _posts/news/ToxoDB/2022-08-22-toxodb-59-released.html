  <h3>Annual VEuPathDB Workshop (Virtual)</h3>
    The 15th Annual VEuPathDB workshop will be a virtual event taking place daily on <b>September 6 - 9th, 2022</b> from <b>9am - 1pm Eastern</b>. Join us for these 4 half-day sessions to learn how to effectively use VEuPathDB tools and features that support your hypothesis driven research. Short lectures will precede hands-on exercises via informal Zoom sessions where discussion and conversation are encouraged. <a href="/a/app/static-content/workshopSept2022.html">Details here</a> or <a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elEnAmi5PvtUNwO" target="_blank">Register here</a>.

  <h3>New data in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Genome Reference Update</h4>
    <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_e6de9bc8d6"><i>Eimeria tenella</i> Houghton 2021</a> now serves as the ToxoDB reference for functional data originating from any strain of <i>Eimeria tenella</i>. <br>
    
    <h4>RNA sequence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_3da11780b1"><i>Eimeria falciformis</i> transcriptome during infection in mice (Dual RNA-Seq)</a> &ndash; Dual RNA sequencing of mice infected with <i>Eimeria falciformis</i>. RNA isolated from ceca from 3 to 4 sacrificed mice per time-point was sequenced and reads were aligned to <i>Eimeria falciformis</i>. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145271" target="_blank">Lentini et al. 2021</a>.  The host portion of this data are available in HostDB: <a href="https://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_ac420074bd" target ="_blank">Mouse transcriptome during <i>E falciformis</i> infection</a></li>
      
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_59fb8debdb"><i>T. gondii</i> during infection in IEC18 cells (Dual RNA-Seq)</a> &ndash; Rat intestinal epithelial cells infected with <i>T. gondii</i> tachyzoites and sporozoites for 8hrs. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362800" target="_blank">Guiton et al. 2017</a>. The host portion of this data are available in HostDB: <a href="https://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_46d2821e89" target ="_blank">IEC18 cells infected with <i>T. gondii</i></a></li>

      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_a20aad37e6"><i>Eimeria tenella</i> transcriptome during infection in chicken macrophage-like cells (Dual RNA-Seq)</a> &ndash; Transcriptome of <i>Eimeria tenella</i> during infection in macrophage-like cell line HD11 cultures infected <i>in vitro</i>. Originally integrated in ToxoDB 57, these data were reanalyzed to include a statistical analysis. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536090" target="_blank">GuitonSandholt et al. 2021</a>. The host portion of this data are available in HostDB: <a href="https://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_0ef6c17001" target ="_blank">Chicken macrophage-like cells (HD11) infected in vitro with <i>Eimeria tenella</i></a></li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>'Send To' actions for the results of a gene search</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Send to My Data Sets:  Save your search result as an ID list in My Data Sets. Open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'My Data Sets' to create your private data set with the IDs from the search result.  Your new data set record will appear on your My Data Sets page as a downloadable text file. You must be a registered {{project}} user and logged in to use this feature. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/SaveListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li><br>
      
      <li>Send to VEuPathDB: Transfer a gene list from {{project}} to VEuPathDB and analyze in context with all VEuPathDB organisms.  From the {{project}} gene result, open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'VEuPathDB.org Strategy'.  The VEuPathDB My Strategies page will open in a new window displaying a one-step strategy that returns the gene list just transferred from {{project}}. Once transferred, use the 'Add a step' tool to extend the strategy and take advantage of orthology across all VEuPathDB organisms. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/SendToVeupathdb.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a>  </li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Upload a gene list to My Data Sets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In preparation to provide gene set functionality such as gene set enrichment analysis we are introducing this new feature. The 'New upload' tab of <a href="/a/app/workspace/datasets">My Data Sets</a> allows for the upload of a gene list into {{project}} directly from a file or URL. Your new list will appear in the All tab and will remain available between sessions. If the results of your last experiment or the last article you read included a gene list, you can upload it here for further analysis. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/UploadListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Sequence Retrieval Tool improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/fasta-tool/genesequence">Sequence Retrieval Tool</a> now remembers your parameter settings during your session. You can leave and return to the tool without having to set every parameter again. </li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
