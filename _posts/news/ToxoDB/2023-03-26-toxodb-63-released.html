  <h3>New features in {{project}} 63</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <ul>
      <li>Site search 'Reference Only' organism filter &ndash; Large results (&#62; 50,000 hits) from the site search are common since it accesses all {{project}} data/page categories (genes, data types, data sets, organisms, etc.).  The new 'Reference Only' toggle offers a one-click filter to reduce the result from all organisms to include only results from VEuPathDB reference orgnanisms.  </li>

      <li>Search details and data sets &ndash; Details for the search and the data sets accessed by the search are now available in tabbed pages from the top of the search pages.  Previous versions of {{project}} presented this information at the bottom of the page where it was easily missed. </li>

      <li>Scroll and zoom on gene page browser frames &ndash; The dynamic browser views on gene pages now provide active scroll and zoom functions with a reset button to return to the default view. Dynamic browser views are available for Synteny, Alignments, SNPs, Transcriptomics Coverage, Protein Features and Proteomics.  </li>
   </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
