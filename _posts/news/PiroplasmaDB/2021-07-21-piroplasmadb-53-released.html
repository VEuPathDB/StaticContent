    <h4>Genome Annotation Update</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_3edcadd790" target="_blank"><i>Theileria parva</i> strain Muguga</a> &ndash; Using the original genome assembly, all gene models have been re-evaluated using new evidence, including RNA-seq data and proteomes of closely related species, and the final gene annotation has now been updated. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245418" target="_blank">Tretina et al. 2020</a></li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 53</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>Genome data set records (<a href="/a/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result?filterTerm=genomes&filterAttributes=newcategory">{{project}} genome data sets</a>) are updated to increase clarity and reduce redundancy of information on the page.  For example, a new table "Explore other Categories of Data Associated with this Genome" contains links to all functional data sets for the organism. The new "Data Context" section provides counts for genes, assembled sequences and transcripts. Functional data set records have received similar updates.</li>
    <li>ID searches such as the "site search" or "Identify Genes by ID" have been updated to find versions of an ID (e.g. ID.1, ID.2). Specifically, searching for the ID will retrieve ID, ID.1 and ID.2, etc, while searching for ID.1 will retrieve only ID.1</li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
