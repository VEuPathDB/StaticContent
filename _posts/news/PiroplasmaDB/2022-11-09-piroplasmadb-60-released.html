  <h3>Pseudogene Classification</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    In release 51 (16 March 2021) pseudogenes with an internal stop codon automatically included predicted 3'UTRs. The UTR prediction was due to an incorrect pipeline which has now been rectified. UTRs have now been removed and all pseudogenes are correctly displayed without CDS and UTR. The affected pseudogenes were shown in VEuPathDB with the Biotype classification pseudogene_with_CDS. This has now been changed to the correct biotype pseudogene. <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/workspace/strategies/import/f9db1d88ac085282" target="_blank">List of affected genes</a>. </div>

  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Genome Updates:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_20ac6df45b"><i>Cytauxzoon felis </i>Winnie</a> &ndash; The assembly was updated to the current INSDC version to avoid small discrepancies between public versions.  The annotation at PiroplasmaDB was mapped to the new assembly. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_020283715.1" target="_blank"> GCA_020283715.1</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h4>Structure Predictions</h4> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_dc1c8cb24c">AlphaFold Predictions</a> &ndash; are updated to AlphaFold Release 4 (July 2022) which offers predictions for significantly more proteins than Release 3.  Use {{project}}'s <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesWithAlphafold">Genes with AlphaFold Predictions</a> search to explore genes with AlphaFold predictions or visit the Structure Analysis section of your favorite gene page to view data relevant to you.</li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
