    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34320186/" target="_blank">BUSCO</a> scores are now available for annotated genomes in {{project}}. BUSCO estimates the completeness and redundancy of processed genomic data based on universal single-copy orthologs. Scores on VEuPathDB were generated with the Ensemble pipeline which computes scores based on the <a href="https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#running-busco" target="_blank">docker provided by BUSCO</a> itself.  <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/BUSCOinPIRO.gif' | absolute_url}}">BUSCO on PiroplasmaDB GIF.</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://veupathdbprod.globusgenomics.org/" target="_blank">VEuPathDB Galaxy</a> now offers a preconfigured ChIP Seq workflow. This workflow processes ChIP Seq FASTQ files by aligning to your chosen reference genome with BWA then calling peaks using MACS2. Peaks calculated from the input FASTQ files are converted to bigWig format which can be exported from Galaxy to your VEuPathDB account.</li>
      <li>Strategy Improvement  &ndash; A new option in the gene result table provides a view of search specific data columns for your preferred subset of genes. Click the 'Show only the Genes in my basket' option from any gene result to filter the result based on the genes in your basket.  This can be used in combination with the 'Send to Basket (replace)' option to view search specific data columns for multi-step strategy results. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/SCCxNTGu-dQ">Filter by Basket tutorial.</a> </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
