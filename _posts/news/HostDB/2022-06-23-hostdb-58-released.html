  <h3>Annual VEuPathDB Workshop (Virtual)</h3>
    The 15th Annual VEuPathDB workshop will be a virtual event taking place <b>September 6 - 9th, 2022 from 9am - 1pm Eastern</b>. Join us for these 4 half-day sesssions to learn how to effectively use VEuPathDB tools and features that support your hypothesis driven research. Short lectures will preceed hands-on exercises via informal Zoom sessions where discussion and conversation are encouraged. <a href="/a/app/static-content/workshopSept2022.html">Details here</a> or <a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elEnAmi5PvtUNwO" target="_blank">Register here</a>.

  <h3>New data in {{project}} 58</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Genome Sequence and Annotation</h4>  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_5ab25f3a67"><i>Cavia porcellus</i> 2N</a> &ndash; Annotated genome of the guinea-pig. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA12583" target="_blank">PRJNA12583</a>. </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>RNA Sequence</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_4f2dc1f39e">mRNA-based anti-tick (I. scapularis) vaccine</a> &ndash; Guinea pigs were inmmunized with 19ISP, an mRNA vaccine encoding 19 <i>I. scapularis</i> salivary proteins. Differential host transcriptional response was measured in blood 2 weeks after the last vaccination booster. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34788080" target="_blank"> Sajid et al. 2021</a>.  </li>

        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_65d43ce7fa"><i>T gondii</i> infected human host cells vs control </a> &ndash; Transcriptome of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> RH infected and control human foreskin fibroblasts determined by RNA Seq. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA316438" target="_blank"> PRJNA316438</a>.</li>

        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_683cbf571a">Transcriptional profile of bone marrow derived dendritic cells in response to infection by <i>Paracoccidioides</i> </a> &ndash; Examination and comparison of the transcriptional profile of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in response to infection by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in resistant/susceptible mice. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255176" target="_blank"> de-Souza-Silva et al. 2020</a>.</li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 58</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>'Send To' actions for the results of a gene search</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Send to My Data Sets:  Save your search result as an ID list in My Data Sets. Open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'My Data Sets' to create your private data set with the IDs from the search result.  Your new data set record will appear on your My Data Sets page as a downloadable text file. You must be a registered {{project}} user and logged in to use this feature. </li><br>
      
      <li>Send to VEuPathDB: Transfer a gene list from {{project}} to VEuPathDB and analyze in context with all VEuPathDB organisms.  From the {{project}} gene result, open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'VEuPathDB.org Strategy'.  The VEuPathDB My Strategies page will open in a new window displaying a one step strategy that returns the gene list just transferred from {{project}}. Once transferred, use the 'Add a step' tool to extend the strategy and take advantage of orthology across all VEuPathDB organsims.   </li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Upload a gene list to My Data Sets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In preparation to provide gene set functionality such as gene set enrichment analysis we are introducing this new feature. The 'New upload' tab of <a href="/a/app/workspace/datasets">My Data Sets</a> allows for the upload of a gene list into {{project}} directly from a file or URL. Your new list will appear in the All tab and will remain available between sessions. If the results of your last experiment or the last article you read included a gene list, you can upload it here for further analysis. </li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Sequence Retrieval Tool improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/fasta-tool/genesequence">Sequence Retrieval Tool</a> now remembers your parameter settings during your session. You can leave and return to the tool without having to set every parameter again. </li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
