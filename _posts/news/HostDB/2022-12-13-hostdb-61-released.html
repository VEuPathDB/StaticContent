    <h4>Associated Data Sets</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Data sets that come from the same publication are now linked.  The new 'Associated Data Sets' section on any data set record page will link to other data from the same publication within {{project}} as well as data from organisms supported in different VEuPathDB sites.  <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/AssociatedDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
