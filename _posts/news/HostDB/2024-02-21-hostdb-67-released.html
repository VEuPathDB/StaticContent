  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <a href="https://elixiruknode.org/news/2023/4-uk-services-cdrs/" target="_blank">Inducted in December 2023</a>, VEuPathDB is honored to join the select group of <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources" target="_blank">Elixir Core Data Resources</a> (CDR). With this distinction, VEuPathDB is identified as a resource of fundamental importance to the life science community and the preservation of biological data, dedicated to the principle of open access for publicly funded research. The CDR program recognizes resources that promote excellence and provide infrastructure vital for the advancement of the life sciences.  Evaluation criteria include scientific focus, quality of science and community service, governance, impact, and ability to facilitate scientific research.

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
