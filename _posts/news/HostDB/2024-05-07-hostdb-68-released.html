  <h3>New data in {{project}} 68</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Proteomics</h4>
    <i>Homo sapiens</i>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_74ac747eab"> Proteomic changes in HCT-8 cell membranes infected with <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i></a> &ndash; Systematic quantitative proteomics analysis HCT-8 cell membranes infected by <i>C. parvum</i> compared to control. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37463621" target="_blank">Wang et al. 2023</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

    <h4>Study Metadata and WGCNA Analysis</h4>
    <i>Homo sapiens</i>
    This data is available in the study explorer.  See 'New Features' section below for more details.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/workspace/analyses/DS_82dc5abc7f/new/variables/EUPATH_0000611/OBI_0001169">Dual transcriptomes of malaria-infected Gambian children (Study Explorer)</a> &ndash;  Clinical and WGCNA analysis variables for the dual transcriptomic (human and parasite) analysis of blood of 46 Gambian children diagnosed with severe or uncomplicated malaria. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950443" target="_blank">Lee et al. 2018</a>.</li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 68</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <ul>
      <li>Long gene product descriptions are now trucated in relation to the width of your browser window.  The full product description is available on mouseover and individual transcript product descriptions are available in the All Product Descriptions table on gene pages. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/Truncated_descriptions.gif' | absolute_url}}">Truncated descriptions GIF</a>. </li>

      <li>The Orthologs and Paralogs table on {{project}} gene pages also serves as a Clustal Omega tool for retrieving alignments between orthologs. This table now includes 'Selection Count' and 'Selection Clear' options for improved tool function. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/Clustal_Omega_Counts.gif' | absolute_url}}">Clustal Omega Counts GIF</a>.   </li>

      <li>The Send To tool is now offered in VEuPathDB.org Strategies. Results created in VEuPathDB.org Strategies can now be ported to {{project}} My Strategies for further investigation. Only genes present in {{project}} species will be included in the ported strategy results. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/VEuPath_Port_to_Component.gif' | absolute_url}}">VEuPathDB.org Send To GIF</a>.</li>

      <li>Newly sorted strategy result tables will now default to page 1 &ndash; Search result tables can be sorted based on any column of data. When a table is sorted while viewing page 3, users are returned to page 1 to view the sorted data table. </li>

      <li>Beta release of new RNA-Seq analysis in {{project}} &ndash; A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_8b52ce9c69">Dual transcriptomes of malaria-infected Gambian children (RNA-Seq)</a> data set. The analysis produced WGCNA modules of co-expressed genes for the parasite- and host-aligned expression data. WGCNA analysis results are available as:
        <ul>
          <li>a <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByRNASeqEvidence#GenesByRNASeqhsapREF_Lee_Gambian_ebi_rnaSeq_RSRCWGCNAModules">WGCNA search</a> that returns genes in each WGCNA module.</li>
          <li>a <a href="/a/app/workspace/analyses/DS_82dc5abc7f/new/learn">Study Explorer</a> which offers metadata filters and visualization tools to help conceptualize modules between host and parasite and modules in relation to study variables so that you may discover and choose a module of interest.</li>
        </ul> 
      </li>
   </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
