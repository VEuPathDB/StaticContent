  <h3>Annual VEuPathDB Workshop (Virtual)</h3>
    The 15th Annual VEuPathDB workshop will be a virtual event taking place daily on <b>September 6 - 9th, 2022</b> from <b>9am - 1pm Eastern</b>. Join us for these 4 half-day sessions to learn how to effectively use VEuPathDB tools and features that support your hypothesis driven research. Short lectures will precede hands-on exercises via informal Zoom sessions where discussion and conversation are encouraged. <a href="/a/app/static-content/workshopSept2022.html">Details here</a> or <a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elEnAmi5PvtUNwO" target="_blank">Register here</a>.

  <h3>New data in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">

    <h4>RNA Sequence</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_ac180a1f35">Babesia infection in dog</a> &ndash; Canine tanscriptome during a controlled infection with <i>Babesia rossi</i> at low or high innoculum. RNA seq was performed on whole blood drawn at 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 days post-infection. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399690" target="_blank"> Smith et al. 2021</a>. </li>

        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_0ef6c17001">Chicken macrophage-like cells (HD11) infected in vitro with <i>Eimeria tenella</i></a> &ndash; Transcriptome of macrophage-like cell line HD11 cultures infected in vitro with purified E. tenella sporozoites. Control cultures as well as cultures harvested as 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536090" target="_blank"> Sandholt et al. 2021</a>.
        <br><br>
          The <i>Eimeria tenella</i> portion of this data is available in ToxoDB: <a href="https://toxodb.org/toxo/app/record/dataset/DS_a20aad37e6" target="_blank"><i>Eimeria tenella</i> transcriptome during infection in chicken macrophage-like cells</a>.
        </li>

        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_ac420074bd">Mouse transcriptome during <i>Eimeria falciformis</i> infection </a> &ndash; Dual RNA sequencing of mice infected with <i>Eimeria falciformis</i>. RNA isolated from ceca from 3 to 4 sacrificed mice per time-point was sequenced and reads were aligned to Mus musculus C57BL6J. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870168" target="_blank"> Ehret et al. 2017</a>.<br><br>
          The <i>Eimeria falciformis</i> portion of this data is available in ToxoDB: <a href="<https://toxodb.org/toxo/app/record/dataset/DS_3da11780b1" target="_blank">Eimeria transcriptome during infection in mice (Dual RNA-Seq)</a>
        </li>

        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_46d2821e89">IEC8 cells infected with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> </a> &ndash; Rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC8) infected with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> tachyzoites and sporozoites for 8hrs. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362800" target="_blank"> Guiton et al. 2017</a>.</li>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>'Send To' actions for the results of a gene search</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Send to My Data Sets:  Save your search result as an ID list in My Data Sets. Open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'My Data Sets' to create your private data set with the IDs from the search result.  Your new data set record will appear on your My Data Sets page as a downloadable text file. You must be a registered {{project}} user and logged in to use this feature. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/SaveListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li><br>
      
      <li>Send to VEuPathDB: Transfer a gene list from {{project}} to VEuPathDB and analyze in context with all VEuPathDB organisms.  From the {{project}} gene result, open the 'Send To' dropdown menu and choose 'VEuPathDB.org Strategy'.  The VEuPathDB My Strategies page will open in a new window displaying a one-step strategy that returns the gene list just transferred from {{project}}. Once transferred, use the 'Add a step' tool to extend the strategy and take advantage of orthology across all VEuPathDB organisms. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/SendToVeupathdb.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a>  </li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Upload a gene list to My Data Sets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In preparation to provide gene set functionality such as gene set enrichment analysis we are introducing this new feature. The 'New upload' tab of <a href="/a/app/workspace/datasets">My Data Sets</a> allows for the upload of a gene list into {{project}} directly from a file or URL. Your new list will appear in the All tab and will remain available between sessions. If the results of your last experiment or the last article you read included a gene list, you can upload it here for further analysis. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/UploadListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Sequence Retrieval Tool improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/fasta-tool/genesequence">Sequence Retrieval Tool</a> now remembers your parameter settings during your session. You can leave and return to the tool without having to set every parameter again. </li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
