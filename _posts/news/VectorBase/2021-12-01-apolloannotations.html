<h2>
 We are pleased to announce the update of four {{project}} genomes: three with structural annotations and one with fucntional annotations
</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
 <li>Anopheles coluzzii Ngousso AcolN1.1 ---> AcolN1.2</li>
 <li>Anopheles quadriannulatus SANGWE AquaS1.12 ---> AquaS1.13</li> 
 <li>Glossina morsitans Yale GmorY1.11, no gene set change for this release, only functional annotations (structural annoations were added on the previous release for this gneome, click here for details).</li>
 <li>Rhodnius prolixus CDC RproC3.4 ---> RproC3.5</li>
 </ul>

<p>This is our second VEuPathDB community annotation integration, which was scheduled for Release 55 (November 2021). We incorporated ~nnn structural changes and over nnn thirds were attributed to Daniel Lawson. All the functional annotations are from Billiah Bwana (Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation, KALRO), her huge contribution expanded the current and previous relase. 
See a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yHaT-2RSpXdyAOBel_yKVu06QOmcE_IS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109864737831887584200&rtpof=true&sd=true'>breakdown of the changes and the data incorporated</a>.
There are over xxx models that need to be pass further quality control steps before being integrated into VEuPathDB, these inlcude species in AmoebaDB, FungiDB, PiroplasmaDB and VectorBase, which migth be updated in next year upcoming release. So please watch this space for details in the future.</p>

<h3>Open invitation to annotate your genomes of interest</h3>
Â 
<p>We encourage all our users to log in to Apollo and edit your genes of interest. If you are new to Apollo or need a refresher, we have multiple resources on 
<a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/apollo_help.html'> the following page</a>
with links to a webinar, tutorials and annotation guidelines.</p>

<p>BLAT search functionality is also now available in Apollo.
Every edit you do counts! This is an invitation to all our users, and especially to scientists working on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> LVP_AGWG,
which we would like to update in the near future, our next release will integrate community annotations from <i>Anopheles albimanus</i> STECLA, 
<i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> Ngousso, <i>Anopheles quadriannulatus</i> SANGWE and <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> CDC.</p>

<p>Please
