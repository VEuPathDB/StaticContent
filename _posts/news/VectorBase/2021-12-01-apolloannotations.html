<h3>
 We are pleased to announce the update of five genomes including amoebas, arthropods, fungi and piroplasmids
</h3>

<h3>We are pleased to announce the update of {{project}} <i>Glossina morsitans</i> Yale gene set, GmorY1.10 ---> GmorY1.11
</h3>
  
<p>The first VEuPathDB community annotation integration with <i>Glossina morsitans</i> was scheduled for Release 54 (September 2021), we incorporated ~600 changes and over two thirds were attributed to Billiah Bwana from the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO). Billiah has not only improved many gene models but also added extra functional annotation that will be included in the next release. 
See a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yHaT-2RSpXdyAOBel_yKVu06QOmcE_IS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109864737831887584200&rtpof=true&sd=true'>breakdown of the changes and the data incorporated</a>.
There are over 400 models that need to be pass further quality control steps before being integrated into VEuPathDB. So please watch this space for details in the future.</p>

<h3>Open invitation to annotate your genomes of interest</h3>
Â 
<p>We encourage all our users to log in to Apollo and edit your genes of interest. If you are new to Apollo or need a refresher, we have multiple resources on 
<a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/apollo_help.html'> the following page</a>
with links to a webinar, tutorials and annotation guidelines.</p>

<p>BLAT search functionality is also now available in Apollo.
Every edit you do counts! This is an invitation to all our users, and especially to scientists working on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> LVP_AGWG,
which we would like to update in the near future, our next release will integrate community annotations from <i>Anopheles albimanus</i> STECLA, 
<i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> Ngousso, <i>Anopheles quadriannulatus</i> SANGWE and <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> CDC.</p>

<p>Feel free to
