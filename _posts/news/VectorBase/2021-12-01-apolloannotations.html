<h3>
 We are pleased to announce the update of four {{project}} genomes 
</h3>

The three genomes with structural annotations include new genes, modification of exisitng genes, and gene mergers and splits, meaning a change in the gene set nomenclature: 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
 <li>Anopheles coluzzii Ngousso <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/record/dataset/TMPTX_acolNgousso#Contacts'>AcolN1.1 ---> AcolN1.2</a></li>
 <li>Anopheles quadriannulatus SANGWE <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/record/dataset/TMPTX_aquaSANGWE#Contacts'>AquaS1.12 ---> AquaS1.13</a></li> 
 <li>Rhodnius prolixus CDC <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/record/dataset/TMPTX_rproCDC#Contacts'>RproC3.4 ---> RproC3.5</a></li>
 </ul>

</b>

The genome with functional annotations include gene name/symbol and product description/putative, meaning no change in the gene set nomenclature (the structural annotations for this genome were added on the previous release, <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/VectorBase/news.html#VectorBasecommunitygenemanualannotationupdates'>click here for details</a>).

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Glossina morsitans Yale <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/record/dataset/TMPTX_gmorYale#Contacts'>GmorY1.11</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is our second VEuPathDB community annotation integration, which was scheduled for Release 55 (November 2021). We incorporated ~nnn structural changes and over nnn thirds were attributed to Daniel Lawson. All the functional annotations are from Billiah Bwana (Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation, KALRO), her huge contribution expanded the current and previous release.

<h3>Open invitation to annotate your genomes of interest</h3>
Â 
<p>We encourage all our users to log in to Apollo and edit their genes of interest. If you are new to Apollo or need a refresher, we have multiple resources on 
<a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/apollo_help.html'> the following page</a>
with links to a pre-recorded webinar, tutorials, and annotation guidelines. However, if you need help with any feature, e.g., how to use the BLAT search functionality, please do not hesitate to <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/contact-us'>contact us</a></p>

<p>
Every edit you do counts! This is an invitation to all our users, and especially to scientists working on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> LVP_AGWG and <i>Anopheles albimanus</i> STECLA,
which we would like to update in the near future. It is likely that our next release will integrate community annotations from There are over xxx models that need to pass further quality control steps before being integrated into VEuPathDB, these include species in AmoebaDB, FungiDB, PiroplasmaDB, and VectorBase, which might be updated in the next year upcoming release. So please watch this space for details in the future.</p>
