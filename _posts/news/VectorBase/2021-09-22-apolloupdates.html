<h3>We are pleased to announce the update of {{project}} Glossina morsitans Yale gene set, GmorY1.10 ---> GmorY1.11
</h3>
  
<p>The first VEuPathDB community annotation integration with Glossina morsitans was scheduled for Release 54 (September 2021), we incorporated over 600 changes and over two thirds were attributed to Billiah Bwana from the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO). Billiah has not only improved many gene models but also added extra functional annotation that will be included in the next release. 
See a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yHaT-2RSpXdyAOBel_yKVu06QOmcE_IS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109864737831887584200&rtpof=true&sd=true'>breakdown of the changes and the data incorporated</a>.
There are over 400 models that need to be pass further quality control steps before being integrated into VEuPathDB. So please watch this space for details in the future.</p>

<h3>Open invitation to manually annotate your genome of interest</h3>
 
<p>We encourage all our users to log in to VectorBase Apollo and edit your gene or genes of interest. <a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/apollo_help.html'>This page</a>
has links to a webinar, tutorials, and other resources if you are new to Apollo or need a refresher. BLAT functionality is back again Apollo since our previous release. Feel free to 

<a href='https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/contact-us'>contact us</a>
if you have any questions

Every edit you do counts! This is an invitation to all our users, and especially to scientists working on Aedes aegypti, which is the genome we now have closer to reach a threshold needed for gene set update, as it just happened to Glossina morsitans.
