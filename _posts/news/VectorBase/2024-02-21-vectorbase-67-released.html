  <h3>Contribute your expert knowledge!</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    We invite all users to engage with Apollo, where you can actively edit and enhance your selected genes. Whether you're a seasoned user or a newcomer, our updated <a href="/a/app/static-content/apollo_help.html">Apollo landing page</a> provides a wealth of resources, including links to on-demand webinars, tutorials, and annotation guidelines. <br><br>
    Every edit you make contributes significantly! This open invitation is extended to all users, with a special emphasis on scientists studying groups of organisms that have recently been updated to integrate new reference genomes, and for the species that are now accessible on {{project}} for the first time. If you're unfamiliar or have any questions, don't hesitate to <a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a>. We're here to help!

  <h3>New data in {{project}} 67</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">

  <h4>Genome Sequence and Annotation</h4>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    The following organisms are represented in VectorBase for the first time. 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_c099af5258"><i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> M1 </a>&ndash; A vector of <i>Leishmania</i> parasites that cause visceral leishmaniasis. A single male (M1) specimen of <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i>, derived from the Jacobina strain was sequenced using PacBio HiFi and Illumina HiC technologies. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-hub/genome/GCF_024334085.1" target="_blank">GCF_024334085.1</a>; </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h4>Genome Updates</h4>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_c3e414cbf3"><i>Glossina fuscipes</i> IAEA 2018 </a>&ndash; This data set was updated with the 2022 annotation version from the INSDC repository. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-hub/genome/GCA_014805625.1" target="_blank">GCA_014805625.1</a>;  <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1685795/v1" target="_blank">Saarman et al. 2022 (preprint)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h4>Genome Reference and Strain Name Changes</h4>
  <!--<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    In response to community input we maintain the ongoing transition to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lqzR7jJTi_NbjTp4y4DpxAilir-ndlWnH-v9NyodGm8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">VectorBase new reference genomes</a>.  VectorBase reference genomes are chosen based on diverse metrics such as assembly level (chromosomes or scaffolds and their quantities), BUSCO, and N50, and in consideration of the designation of genomes as reference at NCBI. All functional data, including RNAseq, will be aligned to the updated reference genomes. While the previous assemblies will persist on VectorBase indefinitely, their functionality will be limited. The new assemblies will encompass aligned omics datasets and comprehensive site functionality. 
    <br><br>
    A notification banner on the genome page of relevant species, will indicate these changes. If you have feedback or inquiries, require assistance, or encounter difficulty locating your genes of interest in the new genomes, please feel free to <a href="/a/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a>.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_c099af5258"><i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> M1 </a> now serves as the VectorBase reference for <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> strains.  All functional genomics data will be aligned to this genome.</li>

      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_13ae5590c9"><i>Anopheles darlingi</i> AdarGF1 </a> &ndash; The strain name was changed from idAnoDarlMG-H_01 to AdarGF1 beginning with VectorBase 66.  This organism now serves as the VectorBase reference for <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> strains.  All functional genomics data will be aligned to this genome.</li>

      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_4582dc809c"><i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> M1 </a> now serves as the VectorBase reference for <i>Phlebotomus</i> species.  All functional genomics data will be aligned to this genome. </li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Annotation Updates</h4>
  <!--<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <a href="/a/app/record/dataset/TMPTX_cquiJHB"><i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> JHB 2020</a> &ndash; The genome annotation for <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> JHB 2020 has undergone significant revisions. VectorBase users contributed changes through Apollo, which were subsequently reviewed by the VEuPathDB annotation staff and integrated into a new gene set, with the structural annotation version transitioning from Dec 04, 2020, to Jul 17, 2023.  <br><br>

    A total of 425 transcripts corresponding to <a href="/a/app/workspace/strategies/import/adaa230d6dbcedce">391 genes</a> were updated, including both structural (intron/exon boundaries) and functional (name/symbol and product description/putative function) annotations. The alterations encompass the creation of new genes, modifications to existing ones, deletions, merges, splits, and rectifications to ensure accurate gene annotation.<br><br>

    Attributions for these modifications go to Theresa Nicole Menna (163 Ionotropic and 53 gustatory receptors), Rong Guo (28 odorant binding proteins) from the Megan Fritz lab at the University of Maryland, and Vitor L. Dos Anjos (181 Odorant receptors) from the Carolyn (Lindy) McBride lab at Princeton University. The distribution of these changes is shown in per event type. <br><br>

    <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
