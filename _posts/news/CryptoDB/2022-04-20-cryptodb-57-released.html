  <h3>New data in {{project}} 57</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">  
    <h4>Genome Sequence and Annotation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_5bcc4b1bd3"><i>Chromera velia</i> CCMP2878</a> &ndash; The genome was updated to the INSDC version    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_018398765.1" target="_blank"> GCA_018398765.1</a>.  AmoebaDB continues to host annotation provided directly to us in 2014 from the Arnab Pain Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>RNA Sequence</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_4207fdd0fa">Infected ileum and cecum of IFN-gamma negative, STAg treated mice</a> &ndash; Transcriptome of <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> from the ileum and cecum of IFN-gamma negative mice during treatment with or without STAg. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34928716" target="_blank"> Gallego-Lopez et al. 2021</a>. <br><br>The host-aligned data analysis of this dual RNA seq dataset appears in HostDB: <a href="https://hostdb.org/hostdb/app/record/dataset/DS_df4a73d145">IFN-gamma independent host response to intestinal C. parvum infection</a>.  </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Genetic Variation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/a/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result?filterTerm=variation&filterAttributes=newcategory"><i>Cryptosporidium</i> isolate whole genome sequencing data</a> are now processed against both the <i>Cryptosporidium hominis</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> reference genomes.  For example, the CryptoDB workflow aligns <i>C hominis</i> isolates to <i>C. hominis</i> TU502 and <i>C. parvum</i> Iowa II. SNPs are called against both reference genomes and all searches and tools are available for all results.   </li>
      </ul>

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 57</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <h4>BLAST Tool Improvements</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="/a/app/workspace/blast/new">BLAST (multi-query capable)</a> tool, known previously as BLAST<i>beta</i>, can perform queries with one or more FASTA-formatted sequences and offers many download types. The tool uses NCBI BLAST to find genes, genomic sequences, ESTs, or PopSet Sequences that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence. BLAST (multi-query capable) is <a href="{{'/assets/images/Find-blast-tool.png' | absolute_url}}">available from the tools menu.</a></li>
    <li>A new download option, <a href="{{'/assets/images/BLAST-This-table-download.png' | absolute_url}}">'This table (csv)'</a>, for the results of multi-sequence queries (combined result) retrieves the {{project}} result table for the results of multi-sequence queries (combined result). </li>
    <li><a href="{{'/assets/images/BLAST-56-improvements.gif' | absolute_url}}">View tutorial GIF.</a></li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Gene page sequence highlighting</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Genomic and mRNA sequences on gene pages have a new color scheme.  Introns are highlighted in yellow and UTR sequence are highlighted in pink.  Previously they were gray and blue, respectively. <a href="{{'/assets/images/gene-seq-highlight.png' | absolute_url}}">Example</a></li>
    </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary. Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
