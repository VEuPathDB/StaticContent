   VEuPathDB conducted a <b>User Impact and Sustainability Survey</b> from 14 September 2024 to 7 January 2025 to assess the significance of its resources for researchers worldwide and to explore funding options in light of the changed funding landscape. The survey gathered insights on user reliance on VEuPathDB resources, database usage, key features, and potential funding models. We received <b>1,862 responses</b>â€”thank you for your valuable feedback!

 <p>
   As promised, we are making survey results available in a report that includes an executive summary and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data.

   The results of this survey underscore the irreplaceable, important role played by VEuPathDB in research on fungi, protozoan parasites, and arthropod disease vectors, including the globally important (but often neglected) human/animal and agricultural diseases they cause. The survey also highlights widespread concerns over the possible loss of VEuPathDB, and bewilderment over how the global funding community might allow this to occur. While users are open to alternative funding models, the community strongly favors broad accessibility.

 <p>
   A sustainable future for VEuPathDB may require a combination of equitable fee structures, diversified funding sources, and strategic cost-saving measures to preserve its mission. Feedback from this survey has been invaluable in helping VEuPathDB to formulate its funding model going forward.
