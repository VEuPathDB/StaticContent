We are pleased to announce a new release of our updated Galaxy instance, https://veupathdb.globusgenomics.org. 

It includes an updated version of Galaxy which offers improved job and workflow performance for users. 
In addition to the previous set of tools and workflows, we now offer additional tool such as those for scRNA-seq (Scanpy, Seurat), species ID (CryptoGenotyper), table manipulation (Datamash), and proteomics (MSstats, Search GUI, Peptide Shaker, MaxQuant). Certain tools were upgraded and now function without errors:  bamCoverage, bgzip, tabix and Upload File. 

If you have questions or issues, please <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/contact-us">contact us</a>.
