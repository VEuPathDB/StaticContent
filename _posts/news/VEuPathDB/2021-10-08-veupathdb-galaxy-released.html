  It includes an updated version of the Galaxy software, which improves the job and workflow performance. 
  In addition to the previous set of tools and workflows, we now offer additional tools, such as those for scRNA-seq (Scanpy, Seurat), species ID (CryptoGenotyper), table manipulation (Datamash), and proteomics (MSstats, Search GUI, Peptide Shaker, MaxQuant). Certain tools have been upgraded and now function without errors:  bamCoverage, bgzip, tabix and Upload File.
