  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <a href="https://elixiruknode.org/news/2023/4-uk-services-cdrs/" target="_blank">Inducted in December 2023</a>, VEuPathDB is honored to join the select group of <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources" target="_blank">Elixir Core Data Resources</a> (CDR). With this distinction, VEuPathDB is identified as a resource of fundamental importance to the life science community and the preservation of biological data, dedicated to the principle of open access for publicly funded research. The CDR program recognizes resources that promote excellence and provide infrastructure vital for the advancement of the life sciences.  Evaluation criteria include scientific focus, quality of science and community service, governance, impact, and ability to facilitate scientific research.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 68</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/fasta-tool/transcript">Sequence Retrieval Tool</a> offers more input options such as uploading from a text file or URL. New options for configuring or choosing the type of sequence returned are also available. </li>
      <li>The Product Descriptions table on gene pages is now called All Product Descriptions and contains product descriptions from all relevant sources. The most commonly used product description also appears at the top of the gene page. </li>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByText">Text Search</a> 'Fields' parameter values have changed. Choose 'Product descriptions (all)' to search the All Product Descriptions table on gene pages.  Choose 'Product descriptions' to search only the commonly used product descriptions that appear at the top of gene pages.  </li>
      <li>The Organisms parameter in the <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesByNgsSnps">Identify Genes based on SNP Characteristics</a> search has a new look. Choose your organism of interest to load the Set of Samples parameter with that organism's WGS isolates.</li>
      <li>Compressed files in the <a href="/a/app/downloads">Download Data Files</a> tool are now in .gz format.</li>
   </ul>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data September slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
