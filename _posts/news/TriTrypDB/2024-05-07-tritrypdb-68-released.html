      <li>Long gene product descriptions are now trucated in relation to the width of your browser window.  The full product description is available on mouseover and individual transcript product descriptions are available in the All Product Descriptions table on gene pages. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/Truncated_descriptions.gif' | absolute_url}}">Truncated descriptions GIF</a>. </li>

      <li>The Orthologs and Paralogs table on {{project}} gene pages also serves as a Clustal Omega tool for retrieving alignments between orthologs. This table now includes 'Selection Count' and 'Selection Clear' options for improved tool function. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/Clustal_Omega_Counts.gif' | absolute_url}}">Clustal Omega Counts GIF</a>.   </li>

      <li>The Send To tool is now offered in VEuPathDB.org Strategies. Results created in VEuPathDB.org Strategies can now be ported to {{project}} My Strategies for further investigation. Only genes present in {{project}} species will be included in the ported strategy results. <a target="_blank" href="{{'/assets/images/news/VEuPath_Port_to_Component.gif' | absolute_url}}">VEuPathDB.org Send To GIF</a>.</li>

      <li>Newly sorted strategy result tables will now default to page 1 &ndash; Search result tables can be sorted based on any column of data. When a table is sorted while viewing page 3, users are returned to page 1 to view the sorted data table. </li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data September slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
