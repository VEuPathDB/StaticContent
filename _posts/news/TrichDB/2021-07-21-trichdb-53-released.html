  <h3>New features in {{project}} 53</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
   <ul>
    <li>Genome data set records (<a href="/a/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result?filterTerm=genomes&filterAttributes=newcategory">{{project}} genome data sets</a>) are updated to increase clarity and reduce redundancy of information on the page.  For example, a new table "Explore other Categories of Data Associated with this Genome" contains links to all functional data sets for the organism. The new "Data Context" section provides counts for genes, assembled sequences and transcripts. Functional data set records have received similar updates.</li>
    <li>ID searches such as the "site search" or "Identify Genes by ID" have been updated to find versions of an ID (e.g. ID.1, ID.2). Specifically, searching for the ID will retrieve ID, ID.1 and ID.2, etc, while searching for ID.1 will retrieve only ID.1</li>
    <li>The community annotation software, Apollo, was updated to version 2.6.5 (<a href="https://apollo.veupathdb.org/1831134177781582126148319042/about" target="_blank">About Apollo</a>.</li>
    <li>The BLAT sequence search tool is integrated into Apollo. Use the 'Search' tab from the annotator panel to find your sequence of interest in our Apollo-available genomes. (<a href="assets/images/ApolloBLAT.png">ApolloBLAT.png</a>)</li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
