  <h3>Annual VEuPathDB Workshop (Virtual)</h3>
    The 15th Annual VEuPathDB workshop will be a virtual event taking place daily on <b>September 6 - 9th, 2022</b> from <b>9am - 1pm Eastern</b>. Join us for these 4 half-day sessions to learn how to effectively use VEuPathDB tools and features that support your hypothesis driven research. Short lectures will precede hands-on exercises via informal Zoom sessions where discussion and conversation are encouraged. <a href="/a/app/static-content/workshopSept2022.html">Details here</a> or <a href="https://ugeorgia.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elEnAmi5PvtUNwO" target="_blank">Register here</a>.

  <h3>New features in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  
  <h4>{{project}} site search accesses Apollo data</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Gene annotation updates entered in <a target="_blank" href="/a/app/static-content/apollo_help.html">{{project}} Apollo</a> are now indexed and available to the site search.  Genes with Apollo annotations that contain your search term will be available in site search results under >Genes >Filter gene fields.</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Gene page navigation improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The RNA-Seq Transcription Summary graph now links directly to the Transcript Expression table. Click a data set title in the RNA-Seq Transcription Summary graph to navigate directly to the details for the same data set in the Transcript Expression table.</li>
      <li>The gene page content navigation tool now contains links to every table or attribute on the gene page. Open each numbered data section to reveal links to all data within the section.  Or use the 'expand all' link at the top of the content tool to view all links.</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>AlphaFold data available</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein structure predictions from <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaFold</a> are now available in {{project}}.  The AlphaFold database was downloaded and structures were associated to {{project}} genes via the UniProt ID. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265844/" target="_blank">Jumper et al. 2021</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34791371/" target="_blank">Varadi et al. 2022</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="/a/app/search/transcript/GenesWithAlphafold">AlphaFold search</a> returns all genes with AlphaFold predictions in {{project}}.</li>
      <li>Gene pages include a table of AlphaFold data and the AlphaFold 3D viewer for dynamic visualization of the predicted structure. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>No New data in {{project}} 59</h3>
  <!--<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <h4>Genome Sequence and Annotation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/a/app/record/dataset/DS_cfaf5b6efd"><i>Tritrichomonas foetus </i>strain K</a> &ndash; Isolated from the urogenital tract of a Brazilian bull in 1975. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Genome coverage: 73x.        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28428299" target="_blank">Benchimol et al.</a></li>

   <br><br>Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct errors in old data when necessary.  Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ã˜) the search and ask you to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.
