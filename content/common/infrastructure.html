<h1>VEuPathDB Infrastructure Document</h1>

<div class="static-content">

<p>This document provides a high-level overview of the software infrastructure utilized by the VEuPathDB BRC to load, 
  integrate and provide data to users. Please check <a target="_blank" href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result">
  a list of all the data sets</a> loaded in our VEuPathDB sites utilizing this infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Browser Compatibility Statement</h3>
<p>We recognize that our users access VEuPathDB using various Internet Browsers and Operating Systems. Our goal is to ensure that you have the best possible experience on VEuPathDB, but it is impossible to develop applications that work identically, efficiently and effectively on all web browsers.</p>
<p>Based on our site usage statistics we support the following browsers used by greater than 95% of our visitors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>Chrome</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Loading and Database Schema</h3>
<p>We use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/GusSchema"><b>G</b>enomics <b>U</b>nified <b>S</b>chema (GUS) database schema</a> and 
  data loading infrastructure and its framework available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/GusAppFramework">GusAppFramework</a>.  
  This includes not only a comprehensive database schema for integrating and representing genomic and functional (or post) 
  genomic data but also tools for loading said data into that system.  We have made some extensions to the schema and tools for 
  VEuPathDB specific purposes primarily to generate de-normalized views of the data for query optimization purposes.</p>
<p>Most of the heavy data processing and compute is done by our data processing team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) where we utilize the large compute facility available there.</p>
<p>Our data are all stored in Oracle12c databases.  Our software infrastructure also supports PostgreSQL but we have some Oracle 
  specific SQL constructs in our model that would need to be changed in order to run successfully in PostgreSQL.  </p>
<p>We load all data using an in house engineered workflow system called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/ReFlow">
  ReFlow</a>.  Briefly, ReFlow is engineered to be an efficient graph-based workflow system. In it each step (node in the graph) has 
  the ability to be undone and subsequently rerun with updated data.  This was a significant requirement as it enables us to undo entire
  genomes when the annotation or underlying sequence changes.  This results in automated removal of all data dependent on that genome. 
  When the step is re-run with the new annotation, all dependent data are recomputed and reloaded automatically, thus greatly improving
  our ability to keep these complex databases up-to-date.</p>
<p>The ReFlow workflow system utilizes another piece of software developed at the University of Pennsylvania to schedule, manage and
  monitor running tasks called 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fpub%3Fid%3D1BixZ5t2c0hnOZES-Rk2wG2loAQqclcmRj7AeKQjZMHA">DistribJob</a>.  
  DistribJob distributes tasks generated from a large input dataset such as a set of sequences to compute nodes in a cluster for analysis
  and retrieves and collates the results in an efficient manner. We automate the running of large compute tasks on compute clusters 
  located at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia.</p>

<h3>Web Presentation System and User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Our websites are based on code that we developed and have released to the community called the Strategies-WDK (Strategies Web 
  Development Kit) which enables the graphical strategies search system.  You can download the software and see documentation for this
  toolkit at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EuPathDB/WDK">Strategies-WDK</a>.  This toolkit enables us to represent our 
  data as an XML model which is then turned into the web interfaces that are presented to users using these tools. As we develop new
  tools and services, we are transitioning towards a cloud-ready Restful architecture with user workspaces accessing tools 
  in containerized services.</p>

<h3>System Hardware and Third Party Software</h3>
<p>VEuPathDB maintains redundant database and content web servers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia to 
  minimize interruptions for our users during maintenance periods. Additionally VEuPathDB compute and data loading servers are located at
  the University of Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>Server configurations are coordinated and deployed through Puppet automation software (<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">http://puppetlabs.com/</a>). 
  Custom infrastructure software is versioned and deployed through standard RPM/YUM mechanisms. When appropriate, software builds are 
  automated using Jenkins Continuous Integration Server (<a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank">http://jenkins-ci.org/</a>)</p>
<p>System infrastructure statistics (CPU load, I/O, etc) are gathered with collectd (<a href="http://collectd.org/" target="_blank">http://collectd.org/</a>) 
  and in-house applications and feed to Graphite (<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">http://graphite.wikidot.com/</a>) 
  for human review. Nagios (<a href="http://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nagios.org/</a>) provides notifications of system
  degradations.</p>
<p>Both Universities also maintain large compute clusters that are heavily utilized by VEuPathDB in order to analyze and load incoming
  data in a timely fashion. The linked document below describes our actual hardware and includes a list of third-party software required
  in order to analyze, load and present data via our websites.</p>
