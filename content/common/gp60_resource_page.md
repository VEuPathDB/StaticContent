<p><b>What is gp60?</b> Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease. The gp60 gene encodes the 60-kDa glycoprotein (GP60), also known as GP40/15 due to proteolytic cleavage. This glycoprotein is highly polymorphic, making it an ideal marker for genetic subtyping of Cryptosporidium species. gp60 subtyping is commonly used to study the diversity, transmission, and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium species, especially <i>C. hominis</i> (mainly infecting humans) and <i>C. parvum</i> (infecting humans and other mammals).</p>
