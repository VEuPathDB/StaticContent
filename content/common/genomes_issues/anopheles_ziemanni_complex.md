<h1><i>Anopheles coustani</i> AcouGA1 and <i>An. ziemanni</i> AzieGA1 species complex</h1>

<div class="static-content">

<p>
<i>Anopheles coustani</i> AcouGA1 and <i>A. ziemanni</i> AzieGA1 genomes are part of the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/anopheles-reference-genomes-project/"><i>Anopheles</i> Reference Genomes Project</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Following its release on <a href="https://www.insdc.org/">INSDC</a> and VectorBase (21 February 2024), it became apparent that the currently available morphological and molecular data, is not conclusive enough for confident species identification: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>AzieGA1 morphological species identification shows inconclusive <i>A. ziemanni/A. coustani</i> classification.</li>
  <li>AzieGA1 assembly has at least four large chromosomal inversions relative to AcouGA1.</li>
  <li>The COI barcode from AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 mitochondrial genomes is consistent with public <i>An. coustani/An. ziemanni</i> records in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) Barcode Index Number (BIN) <a href="[url](https://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAN9442)">AAN9442</a>, so reliable species discrimination with this marker is not possible.</li>
    <li>ITS2 analysis against records in NCBI GenBank with BLAST reveals distinct clusters: </li>

<ul>
  <li>AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 sequences are identical to each other and fall within the cluster containing mostly <i>An. coustani</i></li>
  <li> Other closely related clusters include mostly unidentified species but also some <i>An. coustani</i></li>
  <li> There are no reliable <i>An. ziemanni</i> ITS2 records</li>
</ul>
  
  <li>An additional unscaffolded genome in progress with the <i>Anopheles</i> Reference Genomes Project, generated from a sample morphologically identified as <i>An. ziemanni</i> has ITS2 sequence grouping with an unidentified species cluster. This could represent true <i>An. ziemanni</i> or other species. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>In summary</b>, AzieGA1 is more likely <i>An. coustani</i> based on current data. However, our understanding of this species group's genomics is insufficient for confident assertions.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in furthering the study of this <b>species complex</b>, please feel free to do so, as there is currently no active pursuit of this subject within the genome sequencing project consortium.
