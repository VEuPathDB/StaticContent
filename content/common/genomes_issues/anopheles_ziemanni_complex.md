<h3>Anopheles coustani AcouGA1 and An. ziemanni AzieGA1 species complex</h3>

Anopheles coustani AcouGA1 and A. ziemanni AzieGA1 genomes are part of the Anopheles Reference Genomes Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/anopheles-reference-genomes-project/ >. Following its release on INSDC <https://www.insdc.org/ > and VectorBase, it became apparent that the currently available morphological and molecular data (21 February 2024), is not conclusive enough for confident species identification: 

- AzieGA1 morphological species identification shows inconclusive A. ziemanni/A. coustani classification. 

- AzieGA1 assembly has at least four large chromosomal inversions relative to AcouGA1. 

- The COI barcode from AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 mitochondrial genomes is consistent with public An. coustani/An. ziemanni records in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) Barcode Index Number (BIN) AAN9442 (https://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAN9442), so reliable species discrimination with this marker is not possible. 

- ITS2 analysis against records in NCBI GenBank with BLAST reveals distinct clusters: 
- AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 sequences are identical to each other and fall within the cluster containing mostly An. coustani
- other closely related clusters include mostly unidentified species but also some An. coustani
- there are no reliable An. ziemanni ITS2 records
- an additional unscaffolded genome in progress with the Anopheles Reference Genomes Project, generated from a sample morphologically identified as An. ziemanni, has ITS2 sequence grouping with an unidentified species cluster. This could represent true An. ziemanni or other species. 

In summary, AzieGA1 is more likely An. coustani based on current data. However, our understanding of this species group's genomics is insufficient for confident assertions.

If you are interested in furthering the study of this species complex, please feel free to do so, as there is currently no active pursuit of this subject within the genome sequencing project consortium.
