<h3><i>Anopheles coustani</i>i> AcouGA1 and <i>An. ziemanni</i>i> AzieGA1 species complex</h3>

<i>Anopheles coustani</i> AcouGA1 and <i>A. ziemanni</i> AzieGA1 genomes are part of the <i>Anopheles</i> Reference Genomes Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/anopheles-reference-genomes-project/ >. Following its release on INSDC <https://www.insdc.org/ > and VectorBase, it became apparent that the currently available morphological and molecular data (21 February 2024), is not conclusive enough for confident species identification: 

<ul>
  <li>AzieGA1 morphological species identification shows inconclusive <i>A. ziemanni/A. coustani</i>i> classification.</li>
  <li>AzieGA1 assembly has at least four large chromosomal inversions relative to AcouGA1.</li>
  <li>The COI barcode from AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 mitochondrial genomes is consistent with public <i>An. coustani/An. ziemanni</i>i> records in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) Barcode Index Number (BIN) AAN9442 (https://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAN9442), so reliable species discrimination with this marker is not possible.</li>
    <li>ITS2 analysis against records in NCBI GenBank with BLAST reveals distinct clusters: </li>

<ul>
  <li>AcouGA1 and AzieGA1 sequences are identical to each other and fall within the cluster containing mostly <i>An. coustani</i>i></li>
  <li> Other closely related clusters include mostly unidentified species but also some <i>An. coustani</i>i></li>
  <li> There are no reliable <i>An. ziemanni</i>i> ITS2 records</li>
</ul>
  
  <li>An additional unscaffolded genome in progress with the <i>Anopheles</i>i> Reference Genomes Project, generated from a sample morphologically identified as <i>An. ziemanni</i>i>, has ITS2 sequence grouping with an unidentified species cluster. This could represent true <i>An. ziemanni</i>i> or other species. </li>

</ul>

<b>In summary</b>, AzieGA1 is more likely <i>An. coustani</i> based on current data. However, our understanding of this species group's genomics is insufficient for confident assertions.

If you are interested in furthering the study of this <b>species complex</b>, please feel free to do so, as there is currently no active pursuit of this subject within the genome sequencing project consortium.
