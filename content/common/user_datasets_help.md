  <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My Data Sets are your files or sets of files that are private unless you choose to share them with colleagues.</li>
      <li>My Data Sets originate as uploads from your computer or a URL, and imports from a search strategy result.
          (in the past some also originated as exports from our VEuPathDB Galaxy.)  </li>
      <li>My Data Sets persist between sessions so your files are always accessible.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>My Data Sets workspace</h3>
    <img src="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/MyDataSets.png' | absolute_url}}" />
    <ul>
      <li>View, manage, share, and utilize your data set in <b>{{project}}</b> My Data Sets workspace. </li>
      <li>My Data Sets youâ€™ve created contribute to a per-user upload limit of <b>10.00</b> GB. </li>
      <li>Access the My Data Sets page from the My Workspace menu in the {{project}} banner.</li>
      <li>The My Data Sets page tabulates your files and provides associated information.</li>
      <li>Each Data Set has its own record page (linked in the Name column) with more details and options to download.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Send gene lists from search results to My Data Sets</h3>
    <img src="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/SaveListMyDataSets.gif' | absolute_url}}" />
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>From the gene strategy result page, open the Send To menu. </li>
      <li>Choose My Data Sets.  This initiates the transfer and will add the gene list as a data set in table on your My Data Sets page.</li>
      <li>Open the new data set record for more details about the files and options to download the gene list.  </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Upload gene lists to My Data Sets</h3>
    <img src="{{'/assets/images/MyDataSets/GeneListUpload.png' | absolute_url}}" />
    <br>
    This feature is offered in preparation to provide gene set functionality such as gene set enrichment analysis. 
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Open the New Upload tab in your My Data Sets workspace. Choose <b>Gene List: Integrate your gene list</b></li>
      <li>Complete the Upload a Gene List form. Name, Summary and Upload File or URL are required. The file containing gene IDs needs to contain valid IDs separated by valid delimiters. Upload Data Set initiates the transfer and will add the gene list as a data set in table on your My Data Sets page.
        <br>Valid gene IDs: 
          <ul>
            <li>each gene ID includes only these charatacers : regex: [a-zA-Z0-9().:_-]*$</li>
            <li>each gene ID has at least one alphabetical character.</li>
            <li>each gene ID is at most 40 characters</li>
          </ul>
         Valid delimiters:
         <ul>
            <li>white space (newline, space, tab)</li>
            <li>comma</li>
            <li>semi-colon</li>
         </ul></li>
      <li>The record page for your new data set opens automatically and contains details such as status of the file installation and options for downloading.</li>
