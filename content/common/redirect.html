<h1>All VEuPathDB Genomics Databases Are Offline</h1>

<div class="static-content">

    <p> At this time, The Eukaryotic Pathogen, Host & Vector Bioinformatics Resource Center (<a href="http://VEuPathDB.org" target="_blank">VEuPathDB.org</a>, FungiDB, VectorBase, PlasmoDB, ToxoDB, TriTrypDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, HostDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PiroplasmaDB, TrichDB) is currently off-line, owing to loss of funding due to the NIH decision to support alternative resources.</p>

    <h3>Status of the Bioinformatics Resource Center</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>We are aware from emails and social media of the extreme dismay felt by our user communities about the imminent demise of these resources. At present, all we can say is that we have been officially informed by NIH that support for VEuPathDB has officially ended.</li>
        
        <li>NIH will fund other platforms under the auspices of the Bioinformatics Resource Center program (see: <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/bioinformatics-resource-centers" target="_blank">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/bioinformatics-resource-centers</a>), and have indicated that this will provide “bioinformatics resources for pathogens, relevant vectors and hosts, including organisms currently addressed in the existing BRCs”, but in the absence of any concrete knowledge of what these providers will offer, or when, it is impossible for us to say how effectively their resources will meet the needs of current VEuPathDB users.</li>
    </ul>

       <h3>Funding requirements for VEuPathDB operations</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li><b>Cost for maintaining VEuPathDB as a static site</b>: The direct cost of maintaining access to existing databases even in static form is ~$500K/yr. Note that without the ability to load new data, improve interfaces, or develop tools accommodating new datatypes, the useful lifetime of such resources is of course limited.</li>
        
        <li><b>Cost for continuing operations in current form</b>: The direct cost of the entire VEuPathDB project in its current form is ~$5M/yr, including (in addition to web site maintenance) the identification, processing, loading, and QC of new datasets; development and deployment of new data analysis pipelines, tools, and interfaces; and outreach activities to ensure effective utilization by our diverse end-user communities.</li>

        <li><b>Justification for funding</b>: The VEuPathDB annual budget is a considerable sum, although in our opinion quite cost effective, given the scale of database utilization and research impact: 2023 statistics show an average of 46K unique users per month, from >150 countries, with the typical user returning approximately weekly to access >100 web pages per visit, yielding 11M page hits/mo, 7 Tb downloads/yr, and a cumulative total of >35K literature citations to date.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>The future of VEuPathDB</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>We have great respect for our users, and appreciate their support and engagement over the past 20+ years. Please rest assured that we will do anything within our power to regain funding and ensure that useful data and tools become accessible again in the near future.</li>


        <li>We will continue to update the community websites as soon as more information becomes available. Please check our websites and social media accounts regularly for updates.</li>
        
        <li><b>In the meantime, we kindly request all users of our bioinformatic resources to help us by taking a moment to complete a brief survey about VEuPathDB usage and impact on your work.
