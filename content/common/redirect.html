<h1>All VEuPathDB Genomics Databases Are Offline</h1>

    <p> At this time, the Eukaryotic Pathogen, Host & Vector Bioinformatics Resource Center (<a href="http://VEuPathDB.org" target="_blank">VEuPathDB.org</a>, FungiDB, VectorBase, PlasmoDB, ToxoDB, TriTrypDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, HostDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PiroplasmaDB, TrichDB) is currently off-line, owing to loss of funding. We have been informed by NIH that funding for VEuPathDB has officially ended. We are aware from emails and social media of the extreme dismay felt by our user communities about this news.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NIH will fund other platforms under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/bioinformatics-resource-centers" target="_blank">Bioinformatics Resource Center program</a>, and have indicated that this will provide “bioinformatics resources for pathogens, relevant vectors and hosts, including organisms currently addressed in the existing BRCs”, but in the absence of any concrete knowledge of what these providers will offer, or when, it is impossible for us to say how effectively their resources will meet the needs of current VEuPathDB users.</li>
    </ul>

       <h4>Funding requirements for VEuPathDB operations</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li><b>Cost for maintaining VEuPathDB as a static site</b>: The direct cost of maintaining access to existing databases without the ability to load new data, improve interfaces, or develop tools accommodating new datatypes is ~$500K/yr.</li>
        
        <li><b>Cost for continuing operations in current form</b>: The direct cost of the entire VEuPathDB project in its current form is ~$5M/yr, including website maintenance; identification, processing, loading, and QC of new datasets; development and deployment of new data analysis pipelines, tools, and interfaces; and outreach activities to ensure effective utilization by our diverse end-user communities.</li>

        <li><b>Justification for funding</b>: The VEuPathDB annual budget is a considerable sum, although in our opinion quite cost effective, given the scale of database utilization and research impact: 2023 statistics show an average of 46K unique users per month, from >150 countries, with 7 Tb downloads/yr, and a cumulative total of >35K literature citations to date.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>The future of VEuPathDB</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We appreciate the support and engagement of our users over the past 20+ years and will continue to update our user communities via our websites and social media accounts. <b>Please rest assured that we will do everything within our power to regain funding and make VEuPathDB resources accessible again in the near future.</b></li>
        
        <li><b>Please help us by completing a brief survey about VEuPathDB usage and impact on your work.</b></li>
