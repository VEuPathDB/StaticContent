   <h2 id="data-sharing-irb">If I want to share data via ClinEpiDB, do I need to include data sharing in my IRB/ Human subjects/ Ethical review board proposal?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Yes! If you intend to make data available, it’s important to include that in your consent forms and your IRB proposal.

  <h2 id="data-access-level">How do I determine an appropriate data access level for my study?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>There are currently 5 possible data access levels (public, controlled, protected, private, and prerelease). See the <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/static-content/ClinEpiDB/access_and_use.html">Data Access and Use Policy</a> to learn more about the restrictions of each level.

  <h2 id="datasets-preserved">How are the datasets preserved?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Datasets integrated into ClinEpiDB will be preserved indefinitely. Build database servers are located at the University of Pennsylvania and production instances are mirrored at the Universities of Pennsylvania and Georgia for redundancy purposes and to ensure uptime. All servers are housed in FISMA-compliant computational facilities, and industry standard backups of all data are performed. In case of closure of the platform, reasonable efforts will be made to maintain the site for an additional 3 years and rehouse the data where possible. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="update-data">How can I update my data?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Please write to us at <a href="mailto:help@clinepidb.org">help@ClinEpiDB.org</a> to discuss any updates to your data. Any edits made will create a new version of your dataset, while the persistent identifier will remain the same. Prior versions can still be downloaded via the Download tab. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="delete-data">Can I delete my data?</h2>
  <div>
