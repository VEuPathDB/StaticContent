  <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Upload your data as a .csv, .tsv, or tab-delimited .txt file and explore it using the ClinEpiDB platform. The data will become available in ClinEpiDB as a User Study</li>
      <li>Upload up to 10.00 GB of data with your account as either a single study or multiple separate studies</li>
      <li><b>My User Studies</b> remain private unless you choose to share them with colleagues</li>
      <li><b>My User Studies</b> persist between sessions, so your datasets are always accessible unless you remove them</li>
    </ul>
  <br><hr>


  <h3>Prepare data for upload</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You may only upload single-file datasets. In the future, more complex data will be supported</li>
      <li>The file must be a .csv, .tsv, or tab-delimited .txt file</li>
      <li>The file name cannot include special characters</li>
      <li>Column headers:
        <ul>
        <li>Should be composed of alphanumeric characters, periods, and underscores (<b>a-z</b>, <b>A-Z</b>, <b>0-9</b>, <b>.</b>, and <b>_</b>)
          <ul>
          <li>Any special characters in column headers (including spaces) will be converted to underscores (<b>_</b>) during upload</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Should not start with a number
          <ul>
          <li>Column headers that begin with a number will have an underscore (<b>_</b>) added in front during upload</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Values:
        <ul>
        <li>Should be as you want them to appear on the website (e.g. "Yes" and "No" rather than "1" and "0")
          <ul>
          <li>Categorical data uploaded as coded, numeric data (e.g. 0, 1, -9) will be displayed as a histogram rather than in a data frequency table</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Special characters will appear nonsensical on the website (e.g. <b>Ã©</b> appears as <b>\x8E</b>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Upload data</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>From the <b>Workspace</b> menu in the header, click on <b>My User Studies</b></li>
      <li>Go to the <b>New upload</b> tab</li>
      <li>Fill out the <b>Name</b> and <b>Summary</b> fields. The <b>Description</b> is optional, but a great place to add in-depth detail such as background, study objectives, methodology, etc.</li>
      <li>Choose the .csv, .tsv, or tab-delimited .txt file you wish to upload</li>
      <li>Click <b>Upload Data Set</b>. Now your upload is in progress</li>
      <li>You will be redirected to the <b>Recent uploads</b> tab. Click the <b>Refresh page</b> button if your study appears as in progress (yellow). Once the upload is complete, the entry will turn green and provide a link to your <b>User Study Record</b>, where you can edit the name, summary, and description of your dataset. If the upload fails, the entry will turn red. Please try again and <a  href="/a/app/contact-us" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> if the problem persists</li>
      <li>After the data are uploaded, they must be installed. This process is started automatically and can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours depending on the size of your data. Check the status of installation on the <b>All</b> tab and refresh the page to get the latest status. In the <b>Status</b> column, a clock indicates that installation is in progress, a green check mark indicates it is complete, and a gray icon indicates it failed. If the icon turns gray, please <a  href="/a/app/contact-us" target="_blank">Contact Us</a></li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Explore uploaded data</h3>
    Once the green check mark appears for your data on the <b>All</b> table, you can begin exploring it on ClinEpiDB. There are two ways to access the data:
    <br><br>
    <b>Studies</b> menu
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the <b>Studies</b> menu from the header</li>
      <li>Find and click on your dataset's name towards the top under the <b>User studies</b> section</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <b>My User Studies</b> workspace
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>From the <b>All</b> tab, click on the blue link to your study in the table</li>
      <li>Click the <b>Explore in ClinEpiDB</b> link</li>
    </ol>
   <br>
   Once you have your study open, you can click through variables in the <b>Browse and Subset</b> tab and create a subset of interest, you can create plots and tables in the <b>Visualize</b> tab, and otherwise use the ClinEpiDB platform exactly as you would for another study.
