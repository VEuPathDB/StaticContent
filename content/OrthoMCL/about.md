          <h2>Method for Forming and Expanding Ortholog Groups</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
	    Proteins are placed into Ortholog Groups by the following steps:
	  <ol>
	    <li>The OrthoMCL algorithm (see below) is employed on proteins from a set of 150 <b>Core</b> species to form <b>Core</b> ortholog groups. These species were carefully chosen based on proteome quality and widespread placement across the tree of life. Each Core protein is placed by the algorithm into a <b>Core</b> ortholog group consisting of one or more proteins. Core group names have the format OG6_xxxxxx (e.g., OG6_101327). OG6 refers to OrthoMCL release 6; for each sub-release (e.g., 6.1, 6.2, etc), the Core species and the Core ortholog group names will remain constant.</li>
	    <li>The proteins from hundreds of additional organisms, termed <b>Peripheral</b> organisms, are mapped into the Core groups. To do this, NCBI BLASTP is used to compare each Peripheral protein to each Core protein in the Core groups. (Note that Peripheral proteins that were previously added to the Core group are NOT used in the BLASTP.) Then, each <b>Peripheral</b> protein is assigned to the Core group containing the Core protein with the best BLAST score, but only if the E-Value is &lt;1e-5 and the percent match length is &gt;=50%.</li>
	    <li>All Peripheral proteins that fail to map to a Core group are collected and subjected to independent OrthoMCL analysis, forming <b>Residual</b> groups consisting of one or more proteins. Residual group names have the format OG6r1_xxxxxx (e.g., OG6r1_101327), where OG6 refers to release 6 and r1 refers to sub-release 1.</li>
	    <li>For each subsequent sub-release (which will occur every ~3 months along with other VEuPathDB sites), proteomes from additional <b>Peripheral</b> organisms will be processed as in steps 2 and 3 above. However, step 3 will differ slightly because the previous set of Residual groups will be disassembled, leaving the previous unmapped Peripheral proteins to be combined with the new unmapped Peripheral proteins. All of these proteins will be used to form new Residual groups (e.g., OG6r2_xxxxxx).</li>
	    <li>During a sub-release, the proteomes of some species will be updated to the latest version. This can be easily done for a Peripheral species: the old set of proteins are removed from ortholog groups and then the new set is mapped into groups as above. However, this is not possible for Core species because these proteins are used to define Core groups. Thus, the Core species with the older proteome remains on the site but is superficially retired by appending its abbreviation with -old (e.g., aaeg becomes aaeg-old). Then, the latest version of the proteome is mapped in as a peripheral species and obtains the original species abbreviation (e.g., aaeg is a peripheral with a more recent proteome than aaeg-old). These retired species will be eliminated fully when a new set of Core species is defined, as described in the next point.</li>
	    <li>On occasion, the set of Core species will be re-defined, as more appropriate proteomes become available and/or when a large number of Core species are retired. In this case, new Core groups (e.g., OG7_xxxxxx) and Residual groups (e.g., OG7r1_xxxxxx) will be formed from the latest version of proteomes from a carefully-chosen set of core species.</li>
	  </ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This design allows for the addition of proteomes at every sub-release (e.g., 6.1, 6.2, etc). Note that <b>Core</b> groups (e.g., OG6_101327) will remain between sub-releases, though these groups will expand as Peripheral proteins are mapped in. In contrast, <b>Residual</b> groups will exist only for that sub-release; thus, Residual groups are useful in allowing the user to find proteins related to their protein(s) of interest, but are not stable groups.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Orthologs are homologs separated by speciation events.  Paralogs are homologs separated
            by duplication events. Detection of orthologs is becoming much more important with the
            rapid progress in genome sequencing (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/10/2157/5523206" target="_blank">Glover et al. 2019</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            OrthoMCL is a genome-scale algorithm for grouping orthologous protein sequences. It
            provides not only groups shared by two or more species/genomes, but also groups
            representing species-specific gene expansion families. Thus, it serves as an important
            utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL starts with reciprocal best
            hits within each genome as potential in-paralog/recent paralog pairs and reciprocal best
            hits across any two genomes as potential ortholog pairs.  Related proteins are interlinked
            in a similarity graph. Then, MCL (Markov Clustering algorithm; <a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/848" target="_blank">Dongen 2000</a>;
            <a href="http://micans.org/mcl/" target="_blank">www.micans.org/mcl</a>) is invoked to split mega-clusters.
            This process is analogous to the manual review in COG construction.  MCL clustering is
            based on weights between each pair of proteins, so to correct for differences in
            evolutionary distance the weights are normalized before running MCL.
          </p>
          <p>
            OrthoMCL is similar to the INPARANOID algorithm (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022283600951970?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Remm et al. 2001</a>) but is extended
            to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups
            identified by EGO (<a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/3/493.long" target="_blank">Lee et al. 2002</a>), and an analysis using EC number suggests a
            high degree of reliability (<a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/9/2178" target="_blank">Li et al. 2003</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            We evaluated the performance of seven widely-used orthology detection algorithms that use three general
	    prediction strategies: phylogeny-based, evolutionary distance-based and BLAST-based (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000383" target="_blank">Chen, et al. 2007</a>).
	    Specifically, we used Latent Class Analysis (LCA), a statistical technique appropriate for testing large data
	    sets when no gold standard is available. Our results show an overall trade-off between sensitivity and
	    specificity among these algorithms, with INPARANOID and OrthoMCL performing best with False Positive
            (FP) and False Negative (FN) error rates lower than 20%.
