= Static Content Plugins

== `site-search.rb`

This plugin generates a SOLR friendly JSON representation of all of the static
content in this repo.

The plugin is called after the Jekyll content is rendered as HTML but before it
is written out to file.

It passes each generated page and collection to a "post-process" binary
executable from the
link:https://github.com/VEuPathDB/StaticContent/tree/master/_scripts[`_scripts`]
directory.

For more information about the binary executables, see the readme in the
link:https://github.com/VEuPathDB/StaticContent/tree/master/_scripts[`_scripts`]
directory or the readme in the
link:https://github.com/VEuPathDB/jekyll-site-search[jekyll-site-search] repo.
