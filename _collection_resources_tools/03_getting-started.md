<b>SEARCH STRATEGY SYSTEM</b>: Discover meaningful biological relationships from large volumes of data<br>
   <p class="indent">The strategy system offers over 100 structured searches that can be combined to produce multi-step strategies. Each search queries a specific data set and returns a list of records that share the biological characteristic defined by the data. To run a search, navigate to one from the Search For... menu, adjust the search parameters if desired, and then click Get Answer.  Your results are presented in the My Strategies section.  <br>
