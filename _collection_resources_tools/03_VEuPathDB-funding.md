     <li>Wellcome Trust discretionary award</li>: entitled: “Pioneering a User-Supported Financial Sustainability Model for Essential Database Resources,” this grant provides bridge funding as we transition to financially sustainable subscription-based operations, establishing a model potentially applicable to other high-value, cost-effective informatics resources, and subsidies covering subscriptions for underfunded groups, including LMIC researchers, early-career investigators, and instructors.
     <li>BBR24 grant</li>: This is a new FungiDB/VEuPathDB & Ensembl partnership, a three-year initiative to expand resources for fungal and oomycete plant pathogens, supported by the Bioinformatics and Biological Resources Fund.
