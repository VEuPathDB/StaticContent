VEuPathDB genomic databases began offering bioinformatics services under a new organizational structure on October 2, 2024 after 20 years of serving the global scientific community with customized tools that support of hypothesis driven research. We envision a future where we provide established functionalities as well as improve, streamline and grow the resource with front line data and tools in collaboration with researchers worldwide.<br><br>

<b>Access starting October 2, 2024</b>:<br>
   <p class="indent">All VEuPathDB sites are functional with free access worldwide, although we now require all users to log in. Accurate usage data will inform current resource allocation and future work. You will be prompted to log in to existing accounts or register for a new one. Registration is free and compliant with privacy standards. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">https://gdpr-info.eu/</a>  </p>
<br>

<b>Incorporation of new tools and data</b>: <br>
   <p class="indent">We are grateful be online with support from The Foundation for the Advancement of Science & Medicine, Open Philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Universities of Pennsylvania and Georgia. These donors also provide 1 - 2 years of partial funding for organizational restructuring and limited new database builds. New tool and feature development will be driven by the needs of all research communities we serve, and will rely on additional funding. </p>


<b>Funding</b>: <br>
   <p class="indent">Long term sustainability of VEuPathDB depends on additional funding which will likely involve a combination of grants, donations and service contracts. We strive for transparent and open communications, especially during this time of change. Stay tuned for more information as we make progress.
