Starting March 2025, VEuPathDB is implementing a subscription service that will keep our resources open and accessible to everyone while sustaining our operations.

<div class="survey-link">
  <a href="https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/static-content/subscriptions.html" target="_blank">Subscribe Now</a>
</div>

<b>Why have we moved to a subscription model?</b> VEuPathDB is freely accessible to anyone, but maintaining and updating database resources is not free. The changing funding landscape makes it difficult to sustain essential infrastructure through grants, necessitating a mandatory subscription service, even if your applicable subscription fee is $0.

<b>How is the subscription fee determined?</b> Fees have been established through consultation with our user communities, and are based on the scale of your group's operation and frequency of usage for data-mining and dissemination.

Please visit the <a href="https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/static-content/subscriptions.html">Subscription Page</a> to determine your fair share of VEuPathDBâ€™s annual costs and to generate an invoice.

Your support is invaluable for keeping the VEuPathDB resources alive. Please <a href="https://qa.plasmodb.org/plasmo.b69/app/static-content/why-subscribe.html">visit this page</a> to learn more about how VEuPathDB contributes to the biomedical community and why your support is crucial!
