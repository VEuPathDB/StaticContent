Starting March 2025, VEuPathDB is implementing a subscription service that will keep our resources open and accessible to everyone while sustaining our operations.

<div class="survey-link">
  <a href="/a/app/static-content/subscriptions.html" target="_blank">Subscribe Now</a>
</div>


<b>Why have we moved to a subscription model?</b> VEuPathDB is freely accessible to anyone, but maintaining and updating database resources is not free. The changing funding landscape makes it difficult to sustain essential infrastructure through grants, necessitating a mandatory subscription service, even if your applicable subscription fee is $0 (subsidized).

<b>How is the subscription fee determined?</b> Fees have been established through consultation with our user communities, and are based on the scale of your group's operation and frequency of usage for data-mining and dissemination.

Please visit the <a href="/a/app/static-content/subscriptions.html">Subscription Page</a> to determine your subscription fee and to generate an invoice.  For further information, see <a href="/a/app/static-content/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
