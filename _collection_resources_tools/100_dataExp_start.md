  <h4><b>dataExplorer</b> is a <b>self-service data platform</b> that moves you from curiosity to insight.</h4> 
 </p>

<p>Powered by the interactive bioinformatics infrastructure of VEuPathDB and ClinEpiDB, dataExplorer expands flexible, <b><em>do-it-yourself capabilities for dataset upload, exploration, and FAIR-aligned data sharing</em></b>.</p>

<p>Upload your own datasets or discover those shared by the community, then use intuitive, browser-based tools to explore and visualize the data.</p>

<p><b><em>You remain in control of who can access your datasets:</em></b> keep your datasets private, share them with selected collaborators, or release them to the broader research community.</p>
