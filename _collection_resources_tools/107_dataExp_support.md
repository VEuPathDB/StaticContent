<p><b>dataExplorer</b> is part of the VEuPathDB family of data resources. VEuPathDB is pioneering a new funding model to ensure the long-term sustainability of this globally relied-upon biomedical data resource.</p>

<ul>
    <p>Starting March 2025, VEuPathDB implemented a subscription service that will keep our resources open and accessible to everyone while sustaining our operations. For more information, see the <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/subscriptions.html">Subscription Page</a> and <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><b>A Vital but At-Risk Resource:</b> thousands of scientists rely on <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app">VEuPathDB</a> every day, yet funding for this essential open-access tool is at risk. Without ongoing financial support, the future of this globally relied-upon research platform is uncertain. <b>Your support helps keep this vital resource available to all!</b></p>
<br>
<p>VEuPathDB has a 20+ year track record in making infectious disease research easier and more powerful. Our free, online resources (such as <b>dataExplorer</b>) help scientists study disease-causing microbes like malaria parasites, fungi and oomycetes, and other organisms. VEuPathDB also includes data on the humans, animals, and plants these microbes infect, as well as the insects and ticks that spread diseases like Lyme, Zika, and dengue.

<h4>Starting March 2025, VEuPathDB is implementing a subscription service that will keep our resources open and accessible to everyone while sustaining our operations.</h4>

<p><b>Why have we moved to a subscription model?</b> VEuPathDB is freely accessible to anyone, but maintaining and updating database resources is not free. The changing funding landscape makes it difficult to sustain essential infrastructure through grants, necessitating a mandatory subscription service, even if your applicable subscription fee is $0 (subsidized).</p>



VEuPathDB is pioneering a novel funding approach aimed at securing the long-term financial sustainability of our globally relied-upon biomedical data resource. Funding for VEuPathDB resources comes from voluntary subscriptions by users, donor contributions, bridge funding, and grants.</p>
