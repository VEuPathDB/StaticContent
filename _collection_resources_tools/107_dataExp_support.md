<b>A Vital but At-Risk Resource</b>

<p>For more than 20 years, VEuPathDB has made infectious disease research easier and more powerful. Our free, online resources help scientists study disease-causing microbes like malaria parasites, fungi and oomycetes, and other organisms. VEuPathDB also includes data on the humans, animals, and plants these microbes infect, as well as the insects and ticks that spread diseases like Lyme, Zika, and dengue.</p>

<p>Thousands of scientists around the world rely on VEuPathDB every day, yet funding for this essential open-access platform is at risk. Without ongoing financial support, the future of this globally relied-upon resource is uncertain. <b>Your support helps keep these vital tools available to all!</b></p>

<b>Why a Subscription Model?</b>

<p>Changes in the funding landscape have made it difficult to sustain essential infrastructure through grants.</p>

<p>Beginning in March 2025, VEuPathDB has implemented a subscription service designed to keep our resources open and accessible to everyone while sustaining the infrastructure required to maintain and improve them. A subscription model allows us to distribute costs more equitably across our user community and ensure long-term stability—even if your applicable subscription fee is <b>$0 (fully subsidized).</b> For more information, see the <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/subscriptions.html">Subscription Page</a> and <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<b>Donations</b>

<p>Please consider making a donation to help keep these vital data resources open and accessible to all. Visit <a href="https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/static-content/why-support.html">this page</a> to learn why your support matters, and to read what users are saying about VEuPathDB!<b>
