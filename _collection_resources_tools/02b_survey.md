From 14 September, 2024 to 7 January, 2025, VEuPathDB conducted a <b>User Impact and Sustainability Survey</b> to evaluate the importance of its resources for biomedical researchers and explore funding options following the loss of NIAID support. The survey gathered insights on user reliance, database usage, key features, and potential funding models, receiving <b>1,975 responses</b>â€”thank you for your valuable feedback!

The <b>survey results are now available</b> <a href="https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/static-content/subscriptions.html">in this report</a>, including an executive summary and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data.

The results of this survey underscore the irreplaceable, important role played by VEuPathDB in biomedical research on fungi, protozoan parasites, arthropod disease vectors, including the globally important (but often neglected) human/animal and agricultural diseases they cause.  The survey also highlights widespread concerns over the possible loss of VEuPathDB, and bewilderment over how the global funding community might allow this to occur.  While users are open to alternative funding models, the community strongly favors broad accessibility.  A sustainable future for VEuPathDB may require a combination of equitable fee structures, diversified funding sources, and strategic cost-saving measures to preserve its mission.
