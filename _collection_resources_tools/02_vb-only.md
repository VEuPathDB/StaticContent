<h2>Welcome to the new VectorBase website!</h2>

<p>VectorBase has a new look and new tools to help you better browse and Search vector omics and population data.  Feel free to explore the other cards in the <b>Overview of Resources and Tools</b> section to learn more.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://legacy.vectorbase.org">legacy vectorbase.org</a> site is still available to help you transition to the new site, if needed.</p>

<p>For a summary of the VectorBase 480+ datasets available for each species (genomes, transcriptomes, external databases such us InterPro, KEGG, GO, etc), follow this link in the header menu: <a href="https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result">Data => Data Sets in VectorBase</a>. To view only a subset of this page, i.e., a summary of VectorBase 40+ genomes, follow this link in the header menu:
  <a href="https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/search/organism/GenomeDataTypes/result">Data => Organisms: Genome Info and Stats</a>.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you wish to submit a data set or make us aware of one relevant to your research, to help us prioritize our list filling this only form (in the header menu: <a href="https://vectorbase.org/vectorbase/app/static-content/dataSubmission.html">About => Submit Data => How to submit data to VEuPathDB</a>).</p>
