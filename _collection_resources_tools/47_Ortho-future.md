VEuPathDB genomic databases will continue to provide bioinformatics services under a new organizational structure. For over 25 years, VEuPathDB has delivered bioinformatics solutions to research communities worldwide. We aim to establish a sustainable FAIR Access infrastructure that supports existing omics datasets and tools, as well as develop new tools and AI-driven approaches to enhance genome data and annotation. Our vision is not only to maintain established functionalities but also to improve, streamline, and expand resources by integrating cutting-edge data and tools in collaboration with researchers worldwide. Please complete a brief <a href="https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50ZH5wxLQostZ8G">anonymous survey</a>, helping us to understand VEuPathDB usage and its impact on your work, and guide plans for the future.

<b>Future outlook</b>: <br>
   <p class="indent">New tool and feature development will be driven by the needs of all research communities we serve, and will rely on additional funding. The long term sustainability of VEuPathDB will likely involve a combination of grants, donations and service contracts. We strive for transparent and open communications, especially during this period of transition. Stay tuned for more information as we make progress.
